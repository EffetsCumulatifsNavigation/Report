Report prepared for Transport Canada. "],["summary.html", "Summary", " Summary Through the St. Lawrence action plan, the Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec have been collaborating since 2018 on a common framework for the assessment of the cumulative effects of marine vessel activities on the St. Lawrence and Saguenay River, working closely with First Nations, various stakeholders and coastal communities. A team from Laval University was mandated for a pilot assessment of cumulative effects. The objective of the pilot project was to propose and test a cumulative effects assessment approach in a study area that covers the St. Lawrence (fluvial section and estuary) and the Saguenay River (deep water section). This pilot project is centered on the assessment of the cumulative effects of 7 environmental stressors originating from marine vessel activities on 5 valued components identified beforehand through consultation workshops with relevant experts, collaborators, and stakeholders. The method selected to assess the cumulative effects of marine vessel activities in the study area comes from Halpern et al. (2008) and requires three types of data: 1) the spatial presence or absence of valued components, 2) the spatial distribution and relative intensity of environmental stressors, and 3) the relative vulnerability of each valued component to each stressor. The proposed method combines those three elements to obtain a cumulative effects score that is relative and spatially explicit. The process of gathering the necessary data to apply this cumulative effects approach is referred to, in this report, as the portrait of the study area. The characterization of environmental stressors was done through the integration of 20 datasets and results in the description of 7 stressors divided in 25 subcategories: ancrage (1); déversements accidentels (3); dragage (3); naufrage (1); navigation (11); pêche commerciale (5); pollution maritime (1). The characterization of valued components, meanwhile, was done through the integration of 31 datasets and resulted in the description of 4 valued components divided in 77 subcategories: habitats (21); intégrité des berges (4); mammifères marins (9); sites d’intérêt (43). Finally, an approach combining metrics of exposure and sensitivity – e.g. stressor frequency, trophic impact, resistance, resilience, legal status – was used to assess the relative vulnerability of subcategories of valued components to subcategories of environmental stressors. Here, we detail the general observations that arise from the cumulative effects assessment as bullet points. Additional observations are presented in the report and can also be done by exploring the results of the assessment; we invite the reader to explore section 5 of the report for more information, and in particular to explore the figures provided. Distribution of environmental stressors arising from marine vessel activities The whole study area is exposed to environmental stressors; Major port cities and the St. Lawrence waterway are particularly exposed to cumulative stressors; Shipping and maritime pollution are the most widely spread stressors in the study area. Distribution of valued components The whole study area is covered by one or several valued components; Coastal areas are characterized by the greatest diversity of valued components; The region of Lake Saint-Pierre is particularly rich in valued components; In the maritime sector, the mouth of the Saguenay River has the greatest valued component diversity. Distribution of cumulative effects The whole study area is affected by the cumulative effects of marine vessel activities at varying levels of intensity; Cumulative effects are particularly intense and concentrated in the fluvial sector; the most intense effects are located in the regions of Quebec and the south of Île d’Orléans, lake Saint-Pierre, and the St. Lawrence waterway between Trois-Rivière and Montreal; Cumulative effects are more diffuse in the maritime sector; the most intense effects are located at the mouth of the Saguenay River. Most important environmental stressors Shipping and maritime pollution have the most important cumulative effects predicted at the regional scale, as they are also the most widespread in the study area; Commercial fisheries have an important effect on a limited number of valued components, namely clam beds and some sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest; Anchorages, accidental spills and dredging activities have localized effects on certain valued components. Those stressors, even if less widespread, combine with shipping and maritime pollution and are generally located in areas that are the most affected to cumulative effects (e.g. lake Saint-Pierre). Valued components most affected Sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest are particularly exposed to the effects of marine vessel activities. Although this result is expected considering their high vulnerability in the context of this study, it remains an important observation and showcases the overlap between sites of interest for First Nations and marine vessel activities in the study area; Sites of interest for First Nations in the fluvial sector are more exposed to the effects of marine vessel activities because of the high concentration of effects in the sector; Bank integrity in the fluvial sector is particularly affected by shipping, especially in the lake Saint-Pierre; Habitats that were considered are affected by a wide variety of environmental stressors and predicted cumulative effects also varies between habitat types; Although marine mammals seem less affected than other valued components by the effects of marine vessel activities, it is important to consider the wide spatial distribution of those species in the maritime sector of the study area. Cumulative effects on marine mammals are instead localized and most intense at the mouth of the Saguenay River. Administrative regions most affected The administrative regions of the fluvial sector are the most affected by the cumulative effects of marine vessel activities, and most especially for the Montérégie region. Cumulative effects are mostly driven by shipping, particularly by freight transport (e.g. tankers, dry bulk, cargo, and container carriers) The Côte Nord region is the administrative region most affected in the maritime sector, mostly due to the effects of shipping on marine mammals. "],["background.html", "1 Background", " 1 Background As part of the St. Lawrence Action Plan (SLAP), the Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec have been working closely since 2018 to develop a common framework for assessing the cumulative effects of marine vessel activities in the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers together with First Nations, various marine stakeholders and coastal communities. As project co-lead, Transport Canada has commissioned a team from Université Laval to recommend and test a methodological approach for assessing the cumulative effects of marine vessel activities in the St. Lawrence River (fluvial section and estuary) and the Saguenay River (deep water section), using an initial series of data. In the context of this collaborative pilot project, the marine vessel activities considered include those of commercial vessels, cruise ships, ferries, fishing boats and pleasure craft. The location, intensity and/or movement of these various activities can be environmental stressors. The analysis made it possible to characterize and map selected valued components targeted by the study, assess the vulnerability of these components to multiple stressors arising from marine vessel activities, and then assess the cumulative effects based on the mapping produced. This study was based on currently available data on marine vessel activities in the study area as well as environmental, cultural and traditional data collected from the various participants. In addition, this study involves the pooling of expertise, discussions on methodology and its application to the St. Lawrence/Saguenay, and the dissemination of results. This project will make it possible to develop new knowledge and a common understanding of the potential cumulative effects of marine vessel activities. It will promote consistency in the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate the cumulative effects of shipping, and provide more food for thought for decision making.

In addition to the importance of the engagement process and the engagement of various collaborators, a cumulative effects assessment typically includes, but is not limited to, the following: Identifying, involving, and communicating with assessment stakeholders at all stages of the process Determining the scope of the assessment Establishing the objectives of the assessment Determining the spatial and temporal boundaries of the study area Identifying activities of concern and the environmental stressors they produce Identifying and prioritizing the valued components to be assessed. Establishing a profile of the study area Characterizing the intensity, extent, and frequency of activities and environmental stressors. Characterizing the valued components Assessing the vulnerability of valued components to environmental stressors Analysis of cumulative effects Analytic diagnosis Spatial distribution of cumulative effects Detailed exploration of the effect of environmental stressors on valued components Identifying sources of uncertainty and gaps in knowledge Implementation of decision-making processes Identifying and implementing management measures Identifying mitigation measures Follow-up and adaptive management The identification and involvement of stakeholders (1) and determining the scope of the assessment (2) were defined prior to starting the work presented in this report through various consultation, engagement and workshop processes organized by Transport Canada and the members of the St. Lawrence Action Plan (SLAP) committee. These processes made it possible to take into account the concerns of First Nations, coastal communities and various project stakeholders in order to establish the scope of the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities in the study area, i.e. to identify the environmental stressors and valued components to be considered in the assessment. In light of these processes, the pilot project presented in this report focuses on the profile of the study area (3), the cumulative effects analysis (4), and the critical assessment of the analysis (5). Steps 6 and 7 are not part of this assessment. The next sections of the report outline the steps covered by the contract. 2.1 Objectives The general objective of the pilot project is to develop a methodology to assess the cumulative effects of marine vessel activities in the St. Lawrence River (fluvial section and estuary) and the Saguenay River (deep water section) in Quebec. Specifically, the pilot project objectives are to: Characterize the intensity and spatial distribution of marine vessel activities and the resulting targeted environmental stressors in the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers Characterize the spatial structure of certain targeted valued components of the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers Assess the vulnerability of valued components to the environmental stressors Assess the cumulative effects of the environmental stressors on valued components in the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers 2.2 Spatial and temporal scope The region for which the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities is being conducted covers the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence River and the St. Lawrence Estuary between the west side of Montreal – i.e. near Chateauguay and Dorval – and Pointe-des-Monts on the north shore and Cap-Chat on the south shore, and the deep water portion of the Saguenay River from its mouth on the St. Lawrence River to Saint-Fulgence (Figure 2.1). The study area was delimited by combining the Quebec - St. Lawrence River - Shoreline Classification (Sergy, 2008) and the Quebec Topographic Databases (BDTQ) at 1/20,000 scale (Ministère de l’Énergie et des Ressources naturelles, 2021a). A study grid consisting of 1 \\(km^2\\) cells was constructed based on the delimited study area with the addition of a 2.6 \\(km\\) buffer zone (Figure 2.1). This buffer zone was added to ensure that all aquatic and marine environments were covered by the resulting grid. The code and data describing the study area are available at the GitHub repository showing the study area boundaries (https://github.com/EffetsCumulatifsNavigation/ZoneEtude). Figure 2.1: Limits of the study area for the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river pilot projet. The availability of data allowing for the cumulative effects assessment to be conducted defines the study’s temporal boundaries. In most cases, historical data are not available, making it more difficult to identify baseline states. For this pilot study, the data search was directed towards a contemporary assessment of cumulative effects, i.e., within the last 5 to 10 years depending on the data available. Therefore, no historical data allowing the identification of baseline states were used. It is important to note, however, that where available, data covering a longer period of time were used (e.g. dredging activities; see section 4.2.3). 2.3 Marine vessel activities and environmental stressors marine vessel activities can create a variety of environmental stressors potentially affecting the integrity of the social-ecological ecosystems exposed. An environmental stressor is a process of natural or anthropogenic origin that can disturb an environment beyond its maximum levels of tolerance (Kappel et al., 2012). For the purposes of this pilot project, environmental stressors refer specifically to any processes arising from marine vessel activities that may disrupt various valued components (see section 2.4) in the study area. Marine vessel activities include any activity related to marine transportation conducted in an aquatic or marine environment. Marine vessel activities include not only the activities of commercial vessels, but also cruise ships, ferries, fishing boats, and pleasure craft. It is important to note that environmental stressors affecting the study area from other vectors such as climate change and land-based pollution are not considered in this assessment. Port infrastructure is therefore not included in the pilot project. Any reference to environmental stressors in this report therefore target environmental stressors arising from marine vessel activities, unless otherwise noted. It should also be noted that although the term “stressor” suggests that the activities and processes described have negative effects, this is not necessarily so; in fact, some activities may have no effect on the valued components being considered, or even have positive effects. Considering activities as environmental stressors does not inherently assume that they have negative effects on the valued components considered. In pre-pilot workshops, a series of marine vessel activities and various stressors arising from them were identified (Table 2.1). This list guided the work done to characterize the environmental stressors in the study area for the cumulative effects assessment. Table 2.1: Marine vessel activities and environmental stressors from marine vessel activities identified in workshops prior to the pilot project and considered in the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities in the study area. Marine vessel activities Environmental stressors Dredging Hydrology, erosion, sediment accumulation, contamination Anchorage Substrate disturbance, light, noise, invasive aquatic species, entanglement, pathogens, vibrations Groundings / Shipwrecks Substrate disturbance, debris, light, noise, invasive aquatic species, cargo spillage Operational discharges Aquatic invasive species, hydrocarbons, chemicals, contaminants, atmospheric emissions, wastewater, pathogens, salinity Accidental spills Hydrocarbon/contaminant spills, cargo spillage, atmospheric emissions, bioaccumulation, substrate disturbance Movements (ice-free water) Light, noise, wakes/washes, invasive aquatic species, pathogens, vibrations, substrate disturbance, erosion, collisions, de-icing, entanglement Fishing gear Wakes/washes, loss of equipment 2.4 Valued components The valued components (VCs) are essentially the social or ecological elements on which the cumulative effects analysis is performed. As part of the pilot project, the valued components were identified in advance during engagement activities and workshops with community experts, Indigenous representatives and multiple stakeholders. Valued components were selected separately for the fluvial (Montreal to Quebec City) and marine (Saguenay River and estuary) sectors of the St. Lawrence River (Table 2.2). This list guided the work done to characterize the valued components identified in the study area for the cumulative effects assessment. Table 2.2: Valued components identified in workshops prior to the pilot project and considered in the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities in the study area. Valued components Fluvial sector Marine sector Bank integrity X Habitats X X Marine mammals X Water quality X X Areas of cultural, heritage and archeological interest X X 2.5 Limitations and special considerations The scope of the assessment imposes certain limitations on this study; we have presented some of these limitations prior to presenting the full profile of the study area and cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities so that the reader can make an informed interpretation of the next sections of the report. Additional limitations related to the methodology used, elements of the full profile of the study area, and the results of the cumulative effects assessment are also presented in section 6 of the report. It is crucial to bear in mind that the full profile of the study area and the assessment results can only be interpreted in reference to the study scope: the assessment is fully constrained by the spatial and temporal boundaries, environmental stressors and valued components considered for the study. No interpretation beyond this scope can be made. The results must therefore be interpreted with the resolution, extent, and quantity of the elements included in the assessment in mind; any interpretation that goes beyond these parameters is necessarily erroneous. This study is a sectoral cumulative effects assessment focused on marine vessel activities related to shipping. In addition to marine vessel activities, the study area is subjected to a variety of environmental stressors such as climate change and land-based stressors (e.g. Beauchesne et al., 2020). Thus, this assessment cannot be deemed to represent all the environmental stressors exerting environmental pressures within the study area. Similarly, the selected valued components represent a series of concerns identified by experts and local communities and various stakeholders during engagement and co-development activities that led to this pilot project. These concerns are valid and important, but cannot be considered representative of all the environmental, social, cultural, heritage and archeological components of importance within the study area. It is therefore important to interpret the assessment results only in the context of the identified valued components. For example, a lower intensity of marine vessel activities on the valued components in the marine sector cannot be interpreted as an absence of environmental or social effects. The assessment results would be different if different valued components were considered. For example, an assessment considering only marine mammals would have predicted effects only within the marine sector of the study area; this could not be interpreted as an absence of environmental pressure in the fluvial sector. It is also important to mention that the study is constrained by the availability and accessibility of data needed to assess cumulative effects. Since no new data were collected in this project, the profile of the study area was a monitoring of the available and accessible data to describe the stressors and valued components considered. In some cases, data were not available (e.g. international fleet operational discharges, see section 4.2.7), while in some cases they were inaccessible even if they did exist (e.g. commercial fishing in the fluvial sector and marine noise; see section 4.2.6). Some data are also in the process of being acquired through other environmental characterization projects (see section 6). When they become available, these data can be added to the cumulative effects assessment. Lastly, the study area constrains the profile presented; the profile is thus representative of the study area, not of the elements characterized there. For example, areas of cultural, heritage and archeological interest identified by First Nations extend well beyond the spatial boundaries of the study area. It would therefore be incorrect to assume that the cumulative effects assessment captures all of the effects felt on the areas of interest to First Nations. In addition, the proposed assessment is regional and explicitly spatial; thus, it required data that were regionally spatialized or that could be tied to elements of the study area in order to be included in the assessment. It was therefore difficult to use point data covering only a portion of the territory, and it was also difficult to add social and cultural considerations such as territorial attachment. These considerations are still important, however, and were taken into account in another parallel study conducted by Roxane Lavoie’s team at Université Laval entitled Projet Cultures et Nations Saint-Laurent (see section 6). "],["ceasection.html", "3 Cumulative Effects Assessment 3.1 Cumulative effects 3.2 Method", " 3 Cumulative Effects Assessment 3.1 Cumulative effects The cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is rooted in natural resource management and environmental impact assessment processes (Halpern and Fujita, 2013) and has appeared in the legislation in certain countries for decades, including the United States (National Environmental Policy Act 40 CFR 1508.7, 1969), Canada (Canadian Environmental Assessment Act S.C. 1992, c. 37, now the Impact Assessment Act 2019 22 (1)(a)(ii)), Australia, and various European countries (Halpern and Fujita, 2013). The scientific and grey1 literature thus abounds with publications providing definitions, implementation frameworks, best practices guides, and guiding principles for cumulative effects assessments in environmental impact assessments (Hegmann et al., 1999; Krausman and Harris, 2011; e.g. Peterson et al., 1987). Therefore, a wide variety of definitions and approaches exists (Duinker et al., 2013; see Therivel and Ross, 2007). In its broadest sense, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (Conseil canadien des ministres de l’environnement, 2014) defines cumulative effects as a “change in the environment caused by multiple interactions among human activities and natural processes that accumulate across space and time.”* Cumulative effects assessment is defined as “a systematic process of identifying, analyzing and evaluating cumulative effects”*. These definitions point to the systematic nature of cumulative effects and their assessment, i.e., management of ecosystems and the interactions that structure them as a whole, including human aspects, as related to ecosystem-based management (Christensen et al., 1996; Leslie and McLeod, 2007; Rosenberg and McLeod, 2005). However, cumulative effects are defined in more restrictive terms in policy, legislative, and regulatory texts (Jones, 2016). The 1992 Canadian Environmental Assessment Act defines cumulative effects as follows: “[…] the cumulative environmental effects [of a project] that are likely to result from the project in combination with other projects or activities”. Cumulative effects assessment processes are thus typically conducted from a project perspective rather than a systemic perspective. A number of scientists thus call for the use of regional approaches to the cumulative effects assessment (e.g. Dubé, 2003; Duinker and Greig, 2006; Jones, 2016; Sinclair et al., 2017). Moreover, Canada’s Minister of the Environment and Climate Change recently authorized a regional assessment of the St. Lawrence River area on July 15, 2021, in response to a request by the Mohawk Nation of Kahnawà:ke under the Impact Assessment Act. According to Sinclair et al. (2017), a regional cumulative effects assessment can be defined as follows: ”[A Regional Effects Assessment (REA)] is an [environmental assessment] whose primary or sole defining feature is its regional scope and its focus on understanding the interactions between human activities and the natural world. This means that in just about all aspects other than its spatial limitations, an REA should be comprehensive and integrated.” Similar to a project-based approach within environmental impact assessments, the regional approach focuses instead on the total effects (effect-based) and viability of environmental receptors of interest, commonly referred to as valued components (Beanlands and Duinker, 1983; Sinclair et al., 2017). Several constraints limit its practical application, especially the need to use environmental measures – e.g. variation in the mortality rate of a species as a function of an environmental stressor – to establish the effects of one or more stressors on a valued component. These types of measures are particularly difficult to obtain in cumulative effects assessments; they also necessarily make assessments reactive since effects must be observed in order to establish a meaningful link between the presence of a stressor and the degradation of a valued component (Dubé, 2003). An ideal approach would instead make it possible to combine effects-based and stressor-based cumulative effects assessment approaches (Dubé, 2003; Sinclair et al., 2017). 3.2 Method A study by Halpern et al. (2008) took a major step toward a systemic and spatially explicit assessment of the cumulative effects of human activities on the world’s oceans by assessing the cumulative effects of 17 environmental stressors on 20 types of marine ecosystems. This study showed that few environments remain unmarked by human activities and that most ecosystems are affected by multiple environmental stressors. The updates published by the same group in 2015 (Halpern et al., 2015) and 2019 (Halpern et al., 2019) also show that cumulative effects on the oceans are increasing globally. In addition to being used worldwide, this method has been used many times in different regions of the globe to characterize cumulative effects, including in California (Halpern et al., 2009), the Arctic (Afflerbach et al., 2017; Andersen et al., 2015), and the Canadian Pacific Ocean (Ban et al., 2010; Clarke Murray et al., 2015b, 2015a; Singh et al., 2020). At the time of writing, an assessment using a similar approach is underway for the Placentia Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador pilot area as part of Transport Canada’s national initiative Cumulative Effects of Marine Shipping. Fisheries and Oceans Canada is also conducting an assessment for the Maritimes Region and is investigating the general applicability of the approach to characterize cumulative effects on Canadian oceans. 3.2.1 General model The method developed by Halpern et al. (2008) allows for the combination of the diversity of valued components, stressors, and vulnerability of each valued component to each stressor. The method requires three types of data: 1) the mapped presence or absence of the valued components (\\(CV_i\\)), 2) the spatial distribution and relative intensity (i.e. normalized between 0 and 1) of the environmental stressors considered (\\(S_j\\)), and 3) the relative vulnerability of each valued component to each stressor (\\(\\mu_{i,j}\\)) These data are then incorporated into a grid made up of cells of homogeneous size characterizing the study area. Cumulative effect predictions (\\(E_C\\)) are calculated for each cell (\\(x\\)) of the grid by summing up all individual stressor effects over the set of valued components: \\[E_{C_x} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^m CV_{i,x} * S_{j,x} * \\mu_{i,j} \\label{eq1}\\] This method proposes the calculation of a relative indicator of cumulative effects to predict the risks associated with the effects of multiple environmental stressors on valued components. The term “relative” is central to understanding the proposed assessment method. An absolute indicator would identify a change in the state of valued components resulting from cumulative environmental stressors, such as a decline in the beluga whale population in the St. Lawrence Estuary in response to cumulative environmental stressors. A relative indicator would instead allow for a comparison of the various environmental stressors according to their intensity within the region studied and their effects on the valued components. The results must therefore be interpreted as a probability of risk of the marine vessel activities to the valued components considered. The results of the cumulative effects assessment using this approach are presented in section 5.4 of the report. The calculated cumulative effects predictions can be broken down to assess the relative share of the effects of a single or multiple stressors on one or more valued components (Figure 3.1). For example, predictions of cumulative effects could be broken down to explore cumulative effects on all marine mammals, on a single species, or to identify regions where marine mammals are most at risk in the study area. A complete exploration of all stressor-valued component combinations is possible (Figure 3.1); this offers the ability to analyze different management scenarios and lead to clear and focused recommendations in order to optimize and prioritize management efforts in a region of interest (Halpern et al., 2015). It also offers a flexible and quantitative approach that can integrate different types of data that are sometimes difficult to compare, such as biophysical data with qualitative knowledge (Halpern et al., 2008, 2015; Halpern and Fujita, 2013). Figure 3.1: A fictitious example of spatial assessment of cumulative effects using the methodology suggested by (Halpern et al., 2008). The assessment begins by delineating a study area of interest (A). A picture of the study area is then made by characterizing the distribution of environmental stressors (B) and the valued components (C) allowing the assessment objectives to be reached. The summation of all the environmental stressors allows us to identify the environments that are most exposed to cumulative stress, i.e. cumulative exposure (D). The sum of valued components, on the other hand, allows us to identify the environments in the study area where a higher number of valued components overlap (E). By combining the distribution of environmental stressors and valued components along with the vulnerability of the valued components to the environmental stressors, a relative assessment of individual effects is obtained (F). It is possible to assess the impact of all the environmental stressors on a single valued component (G); similarly, it is possible to assess the impact of a single environmental stressor on all valued components (H). Finding the sum of all the individual impacts provides the relative assessment of cumulative effects incorporating all combinations of environmental stressors and valued components (I). 3.2.2 Partial models The general cumulative effects assessment model can easily be broken down into partial models to explore simplified portions of the assessment. We therefore present three additional indicators allowing the results of the assessment to be explored. 3.2.2.1 Cumulative stressors and hotspots Considering only the spatial distribution and relative intensity of the environmental stressors considered (\\(S_j\\)) provides an assessment of the cumulative stressors \\(E_{S,x}\\) (Beauchesne et al., 2020), which corresponds to the total of all the environmental stressors \\(S\\) in each cell \\(x\\) considered for the assessment: \\[E_{S_x} = \\sum_{j=1}^m S_{j,x} \\label{eq2}\\] The cumulative stressor assessment of environmental stressors identifies the sites that are most exposed to the potential effects of the environmental stressors considered for the cumulative effects assessment. It does not provide an effects assessment, since it only considers the stressors, and their intensity and distribution. However, it does allow us to assess the environments that are most likely to be affected by the stressors in our study area. In order to limit an over-representation of stressors composed of several subcategories, it is also possible to normalize the intensity values of a stressor category by the number of sub-categories that compose it. For example, a stressor consisting of 10 categories would have a higher weight than a stressor consisting of only one category. To normalize the intensity values, the intensity of these subcategories need only be divided by the number of subcategories, e.g. for a category composed of 10 subcategories, the intensity is divided by 10. Using the cumulative stressor assessment, it is also possible to obtain an assessment of cumulative stressor hotspots, which identify environments where environmental stressors co-occur at high relative intensities (Beauchesne et al., 2020). The cumulative hotspots \\(E_{H_x}\\) is calculated in each cell of the study grid and corresponds to the sum of stressors whose intensity is contained in their respective \\(80th\\) percentile: \\[E_{H_x} = \\sum_{j=1}^m \\mathbb{1} (S_{j,x} \\; \\epsilon \\; P_{80, S_j})\\] where \\(P_{80, S_j}\\) is the \\(80th\\) percentile of stressor \\(j\\). The results of normalized and non-normalized cumulative stressors and cumulative hotspots are presented in section 5.1. 3.2.2.2 Cumulative valued components Considering only the mapped presence or absence of the valued components considered (\\(CV_i\\)) provides an assessment of the cumulative stressors \\(E_{S,x}\\), which corresponds to the total of all environmental stressors \\(CV\\) in each cell \\(x\\): \\[E_{CV_x} = \\sum_{i=1}^n CV_{i,x} \\label{eq3}\\] The cumulative footprint assessment identifies the environments with the highest content of valued components. As with the cumulative stressor assessment, it does not provide an effects assessment, since it only considers the valued components. However, it does allow us to assess the environments that are most important for the valued components in our study area. The presence of valued components can also be normalized by the number of valued component categories to avoid over-representation of valued components composed of multiple categories (see section 3.2.2.1). The results of normalized and non-normalized valued components are presented in section 5.2. 3.2.2.3 Cumulative exposure The intersection of the assessment of the stressors and the cumulative valued components provide the third partial model that we are presenting in addition to the overall model, i.e. cumulative exposure. The cumulative exposure \\(E_{E,x}\\) is the product of the intensity of the environmental stressors \\(S_{j,x}\\) and the presence of the valued components \\(CV_{i,x}\\) in each cell \\(x\\): \\[E_{E_x} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^m CV_{i,x} * S_{j,x} \\label{eq4}\\] Cumulative exposure provides an assessment of environments where there is greater overlap of valued components and environmental stressors. Although this metric does not predict the effect of stressors on valued components, it does identify environments where the valued components are most likely to be subjected to the effects of the environmental stressors considered. Cumulative exposure also makes it possible to delimit all the environments where cumulative effects could occur, since stressors and valued components must overlap in order to detect an effect; as such, this metric captures a significant portion of cumulative effects even though it does not incorporate the vulnerability of valued components to stressors. As with the cumulative valued components and stressors, cumulative exposure can be normalized by the number of stressor and valued component categories to avoid over-representation of valued components composed of multiple categories (see section 3.2.2.1). The results of normalized and non-normalized cumulative exposure are presented in section 5.3. 3.2.3 Environmental stressors In the context of the cumulative effects assessment, environmental stressors from human activities are typically characterized using the footprint of the activities themselves as an index of stressor intensity (Beauchesne et al., 2020; e.g. Halpern et al., 2019). As such, the work of characterizing environmental stressors is aimed at a direct characterization of marine vessel activities. Furthermore, each marine activity is characterized by a unique footprint and requires an appropriate approach to properly capture its intensity and distribution. For example, a method for characterizing navigation would not be appropriate for characterizing dredging activities. Individual approaches were thus used to appropriately characterize the different environmental stressors. In addition, some environmental stressors can be divided into subcategories with different spatial footprints or different effects on the valued components. For example, ferries do not use the same sailing routes as oil tankers, and trawling does not affect ecosystems in the same way as gillnetting. We have thus divided certain stressors into subcategories. The characterization of environmental stressors is part of the study area picture and is presented in section 4.2 of the report; this section presents the data and approaches used to characterize environmental stressors in the study area. The diversity of environmental stressors considered for the cumulative effects assessment also requires data transformation; indeed, marine traffic intensity expressed as a number of navigation transits cannot be directly compared to dredging activity intensity in \\(m^3\\) of dredged sediment. All stressors are thus normalized between 0 and 1 to obtain a relative intensity value and thus allow a comparison between different types of stressors. The 99th quantile of the stressor intensity distribution was used as an upper threshold for normalizing extreme values (Halpern et al., 2019). The navigation categories are normalized together so as not to assign higher relative intensity values to vessel types with lower traffic. For example, individual normalization would result in a similar maximum intensity for a navigation category with a maximum traffic of 100 vessels per \\(km^2\\) and another with a maximum traffic of 1000 vessels per \\(km^2\\). A joint normalization thus makes it possible to keep these differences between types of vessels. Environmental stressor data is also log-transformed to avoid underestimation of intermediate value stressor intensity (Halpern et al., 2019). 3.2.4 Valued components valued components are typically characterized by presence-absence in the study grid, although some may be characterized by a continuous variable. For example, marine mammals are characterized based on the likelihood of sighting a marine mammal rather than by presence-absence. This allows us to assign greater importance to environments where marine mammals are frequently sighted. As with the environmental stressors, the valued components can also be divided into subcategories to better capture their diversity. The characterization of valued components is part of the study area picture and is presented in section 4.3 of the report; this section presents the data and approaches used to characterize valued components in the study area. 3.2.5 Vulnerability cumulative effects assessments require the assessment of valued component vulnerability to environmental stressors considered (Kappel et al., 2012; Teck et al., 2010). In general, the vulnerability of a valued component is defined based on its exposure (i.e., the likelihood that a habitat will be subjected to a stressor), its sensitivity (i.e., the degree to which a habitat will be affected by a stressor), and its adaptive capacity or resilience (i.e., the ability of a habitat or the elements composing it to recover from a disturbance) to stressors (Halpern and Fujita, 2013; e.g. Metzger et al., 2005; Teck et al., 2010). A number of methods are described in the scientific literature to assess the vulnerability of natural attributes to natural or anthropogenic disturbances (Wilson et al., 2005). For example, Foden et al. (2011) used empirical recovery time values from the literature as a marker of benthic habitat vulnerability in the UK to apply the method of Halpern et al. (2008). However, the significant gaps in the empirical data available allowing us to characterize all valued component-stressor combinations curtail the use of a similar approach (Halpern et al., 2007; Teck et al., 2010). This type of knowledge can be particularly difficult to obtain, and entire research teams typically focus on the vulnerability of a single valued component to a single stressor; think of the vulnerability of marine mammals to underwater noise. Furthermore, while the vulnerability of certain valued components to certain environmental stressors is well documented and would allow for a robust assessment of individual environmental impacts, this type of knowledge is rarely – if ever – available for all valued component-stressor combinations yet is a necessity for conducting a cumulative effects assessment. A qualitative approach using expert opinion and/or document review is thus typically used to generate a matrix of relative vulnerability scores for all valued components and stressors included in the cumulative effects assessment (Halpern et al., 2007; Kappel et al., 2012; Teck et al., 2010). Using a method in which experts are consulted also enables us to have the benefit of expertise and knowledge that would otherwise not be available to support management and decision-making (Teck et al., 2010; Wilson et al., 2005). Criteria for assessing the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacities of the valued components are thus generally qualitatively selected and assessed. For example, exposure may depend on the spatial magnitude and frequency of a stressor; the sensitivity of a species may be defined by the effects of a stressor on its reproduction; adaptive capacities may be influenced by the vulnerable status of a certain animal population. These criteria may vary depending on the valued components selected, since criteria applicable to a species (e.g. Maxwell et al., 2013) will not necessarily be applicable to a habitat (e.g. Teck et al., 2010). The criteria may thus vary from one group of valued components to another; indeed, this is the case for the various valued components considered for the assessment of this pilot project. A qualitative vulnerability assessment is aimed at assessing each criterion selected to obtain a numerical rank per criterion. These individual assessments are then combined and normalized to obtain a relative vulnerability score ranging from 0 – insensitive – to 1 – very sensitive – for all “valued component-stressor” combinations. The following sections describe how the vulnerability of valued components to stressors was assessed in this cumulative effects assessment. The section 4.4 presents data, approaches and results of the assessment of valued component vulnerability to environmental stressors considered for the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities in the study area. Grey literature refers to the material produced by various public, commercial or industrial bodies, subject to intellectual property rules, that is not checked by the scientific peer review process.↩︎ "],["portrait.html", "4 Profile of the study area 4.1 Data collection and management 4.2 Environmental stressors 4.3 Valued components 4.4 Vulnerability", " 4 Profile of the study area The following sections present the essence of the work done to assess the cumulative effects of marine vessel activities on the valued components of the St. Lawrence and Saguenay Rivers selected for this pilot project, i.e. to form a profile of the study area. Specifically, the following sections detail the recommended approach to data collection and management, present the characterization of environmental stressors and valued components in the study area, and detail the assessment of valued component vulnerability to environmental stressors. 4.1 Data collection and management 4.1.1 Data collection Since this pilot project did not aim to collect any new data, the profile presented is a monitoring of current knowledge allowing the characterization of marine vessel activities and valued components in the study area. The availability and accessibility of data has thus guided the work done. Data were collected in cooperation with the various collaborators involved in the project as well as with the collaboration and support of Transport Canada and the members of the project led by the St. Lawrence Action Plan project. Data collection began by sending a list to various experts and collaborators involved in the project for annotation. This list consisted of subcategories of environmental stressors and valued components. Participants were asked to identify any known databases that could be used to characterize the stressors and valued components within the study area, and to identify any other subcategories or databases deemed relevant to the project. We then collated the comments and suggestions and began the process of collecting data relevant to the cumulative effects assessment. Where possible, priority was given to the open and accessible data from federal and provincial data sharing platforms Open Government and Données Québec, as well as resources available through the St. Lawrence Global Observatory (SLGO). In this regard, searches were conducted on these platforms to identify relevant data that was not included in the previously shared list. By prioritizing open data, it will be easier to reproduce and update the assessment conducted by this pilot project. Appendix 1 presents all the data that was considered for the assessment. In that appendix, the data are described and the data selected for the assessment are identified. Data that were not selected were retained to document all the data that was explored for the assessment. The data that were not included were left out because they were covered by other selected databases or because they did not meet a specific assessment objective. Particular attention was also paid to the knowledge of experts in their respective fields, as well as that of the various project partners. We thus were in direct discussion with resource persons in order to revise the various sections of the profile of the study area characterizing the environmental stressors and the valued components. The resource persons who contributed to the revision of these sections are specifically thanked at the beginning of the sections to which they contributed. A list of resource persons/organizations for this project is available in Appendix 2. Close cooperation with First Nations was also an important component of the project for ensuring that we have the benefit of Indigenous knowledge and First Nations concerns related to the study area. We were thus in contact with representatives of the participating First Nations in order to obtain a spatial characterization of areas of cultural, heritage and archeological interest. See the section on areas of cultural, heritage and archeological interest for more details. 4.1.2 Data management and reproducibility The aim of database management is to ensure the transparency of the cumulative effects assessments and that they are reproducible. Our approach is based on the principles FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), the purpose of which are to ensure that the data used is discoverable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. We therefore use programming tools, in particular the language R2. There are a number of advantages to using programming tools such as ArcGIS3. They offer great flexibility, enabling us to very quickly integrate changes or new considerations without having to redo a number of steps in a complex process. This flexibility is not limited to analysis, since all steps of a project, from the integration of raw data to the production of reports, can be integrated and easily modified. It is then an easy matter to integrate comments or new recommendations arising from engagement processes, for example. We also used GitHub4, a version control tool for the documentation, quality control, and development/change history of programming elements relevant to the entire project. We created an organization named CumulativeNavigationEffects. A listing of all reports written and seminars offered during the pilot project is available here. A public repository entitled ceanav serves as the research compendium and is the core of the assessment; a research compendium is a collection of all parts of a research project including text, figures, data, and code that ensures reproducibility of the study. A detailed description of the assessment’s research compendium structure is available in Appendix 3 and on the GitHub repository webpage ceanav. While not including the data directly, the assessment’s research compendium contains all the resources making it possible to access and transform the raw data. It also contains the code allowing us to characterize the environmental stressors and valued components, and to create the analyses, figures, tables and the final report. Only sensitive data for which confidentiality agreements have been signed remain inaccessible; however, these are catalogued in the report and accompanying documents so that a user or reader can know the type and source of data used in the analyses, as well as the resource persons to contact to obtain more information about the data used. The data incorporated into the study grid enabling us to conduct the cumulative effects assessment are open and available through the pilot project’s main repository ceanav; we are also working with SLGO to make them available on their portal. The databases considered for the assessment are identified by a unique identifier in the form #### for each database considered: the unique identifier is available in Appendix 1. For example, the database 0001 corresponds to an eelgrass inventory (Zostera marina) for James Bay, Baie des Chaleurs, the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Pêches et Océans Canada, 2009). These unique identifiers are used to identify, directly on the figures, the databases that were used to characterize the categories of environmental stressors and valued components presented in sections 4.2 and 4.3; the list of unique identifiers can be viewed in the bottom right margin of each figure. In addition, all data and metadata included in the assessment’s research compendium use these unique identifiers to reference the databases considered. In total, 72 databases were considered for the assessment and are accessible through the research compendium; of these, 51 were used to conduct the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities on the valued components selected. See Appendix 1 for more details on these databases. As with for the data, the various organizations and experts consulted for this project, or custodians of the open databases used, are identified by a unique identifier of the form #### available in Appendix 2. 4.2 Environmental stressors Characterization of environmental stressors in the study area resulted in the description of 7 stressors divided into 25 subcategories that are considered for the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities (Table 4.1). The following sections present the data, methods, and results of the data integration allowing us to characterize the environmental stressors in the study area. Table 4.1: List of environmental stressor subcategories considered for the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river. See Appendix 1 for more details on data sources.

The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0070, 0071. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. Anchorage sites were characterized through the integration of two databases from the Canadian Coast Guard (Garde côtière canadienne, 2022) and the Canadian Hydrographic Service (Service Hydrographique du Canada, 2020). The Canadian Coast Guard database provides the location of commercial anchorage sites from the mooring data sheets between Les Escoumins and Montreal (Garde côtière canadienne, 2022). Since this database does not cover the entire study area, we completed the characterization of anchorage sites using the Canadian Hydrographic Service database; this database provides the location of moorings and mooring areas in Canadian navigable waters (Service Hydrographique du Canada, 2020). We selected the moorings and mooring areas east of Les Escoumins in order to complete the profile of the study area. It is important to mention that the resulting data layer considers only commercial navigation and that anchorage sites for recreational boating are not represented. A total of 101 sites were identified in the study area. To characterize the intensity of this environmental stressor, a 2 \\(km\\) buffer zone was drawn around each anchoring site. The number of anchorage sites intersecting each study grid cell was then assessed to obtain an assessment of the number of sites (\\(n\\)) per \\(km^2\\) with the potential to affect a cell (\\(n\\) sites * \\(km^{-2}\\)). This characterization allows us to obtain an assessment of the environmental risk associated with anchorage sites in each study grid cell by assuming that risks are higher when multiple anchorage sites are located close to each other. It is important to note that we are not characterizing the intensity of use of these sites by vessels here, but rather the presence of anchorage sites. Anchorage site use could be characterized in an updated version of this stressor; however, this work could not be completed as part of this report. Figure 4.1: Distribution of anchorages for commercial shipping in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river. 4.2.2 Accidental spills We thank Pierre Nellis at the Canadian Coast Guard for the discussions and support. The unique identifier given to the data presented in this section is: 0016. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. Accidental spills were characterized using a marine spill incident inventory from the Canadian Coast Guard (Garde côtière canadienne, 2020). This inventory provides the location of accidental marine spills for the period 2016 to 2020. A total of 185 accidental spills were identified for the study area. Each spill is characterized according to its content and grouped into three distinct groups: hydrocarbons (e.g. gasoline, diesel, propane), other (e.g. ballast water, wastewater, organic matter) and spills the content of which is unknown (Table 4.2). The spills are also categorized by the volume in litres of contaminant spilled (Table 4.3). Table 4.2: Categories and number of accidental spills recorded in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river between 2016 and 2020 (Garde côtière canadienne, 2020). Contaminant category Subcategory Number of spills Hydrocarbons Bunker C, Diesel fuel, Gasoline, Unknown hydrocarbon, Petcoke, Crude oil, Propane, Tar, Lubricating oil, Hydraulic oil, Motor oil, Bilge, BioSpec Hyd 32, Hydrox Bio 100, Lube oil, Biodegradable hydraulic oil, Liquid asphalt 74 Others Hypochlorous acid, Ballast, Debris, Waste, Bilge water, Oily water, Wastewater, Milk, Organic matter, Iron ore, Calcium oxide (lime), Ammonium phosphate, Pollution, Sludge, Soot, Caustic soda, LAPIO oil, Hydraulic vegetable oil, Vegetable oil, Oily mixture, Coal 20 Unknown content Unknown content 34 Table 4.3: Categories of volumes spilled and number of accidental spills recorded in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river between 2016 and 2020 (Garde côtière canadienne, 2020). Categories of volumes spilled Number of spills 1 : 0 - 100 litres 108 2 : 100 - 1000 litres 14 3 : 1000 - 7000 litres 0 4 : 100000 - 1000000 litres 0 NA : Volume unknown 63 Since accidental spills have an effect that goes beyond the immediate location of the incidents due to the diffusion of the spill in the environment, the first step in characterizing the intensity of spills was to establish a potential zone of influence for each incident. We chose a passive diffusive model to establish the zone of influence and relative intensity of accidental spills in the study area (see Halpern et al., 2008). The diffusion model establishes the zone of influence of the spills by creating concentric rings with a radius of 10 \\(m\\) centred on the incident site. An initial value equal to the category of the reported incident volume is assigned to the centre ring and represents the relative intensity of the incident on the environment. For example, an initial value of 2 was assigned to a spill of 0 to 100 litres (Table 4.3). As a precautionary measure, an initial value of 2 was also assigned to incidents the volume of which was unknown. A value is then successively assigned to the adjacent rings according to a decay function of 2% of the value of the previous ring, until a minimum threshold of 0.05% of the global maximum – 3 in our case – is reached. This approach assumes a linear decrease in the influence of the incidents on the environment up to a maximum radius of influence of about 3 \\(km\\) depending on the severity of the spill. The intensity and spatial distribution of accidental spills in the study area was evaluated by distributing the relative intensity values modelled by the diffusive model within the 1 \\(km^2\\) study grid. For each concentric ring modelled, we multiplied the intensity value within each \\(j\\) of the study grid by the proportion of the ring area that intersects a \\(j\\) cell: \\[I_{spill,j} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n_j} I_{tot, k} * \\frac{A_{j,k}}{A_{tot,k}}\\] where \\(j\\) is a study grid cell, \\(k\\) is a modelled concentric ring, \\(I_{tot}\\) is the predicted relative intensity within the \\(k\\) ring, \\(A\\) is the area of the \\(k\\) concentric ring that intersects a \\(j\\) cell, and \\(A_{tot}\\) is the total area of the \\(k\\) concentric ring. Since the intensity values correspond to volume categories rather than a continuous quantity, the results of this diffusive model are relative and unitless.

The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0018, 0019, 0046, 0048, 0049, 0050, 0052, 0069. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The St. Lawrence Seaway has historically been dredged wherever the natural depth would not allow boats to pass safely. Between Montreal and Cap Gribane, which is located downstream from Cap Tourmente, about 30 \\(km\\) from Île d’Orléans, the navigable waterway is approximately 340 km long and artificial banks have added over a distance of about 210 km to ensure safe navigation (GHD, 2019). The waterway has been deepened and widened over time, mainly due to increases in the size of vessels and marine traffic. A historic characterization of capitalization dredging activities – i.e. dredging to deepen and widen the waterway – of the St. Lawrence Seaway is described by Côté and Morin (2007a) and Côté and Morin (2007b). Some portions of the waterway must also be dredged at regular intervals – i.e. maintenance dredging – due to the sediment dynamics of the environments. The same is true for certain port facilities along the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers, which must ensure the ability of their vessel facilities to operate safely. In this study, contemporary dredging activities for the period 2001 to 2020 were characterized. Most of the data on dredged and deposited volumes come from a compilation exercise of dredging activities throughout the St. Lawrence (Environnement et Changement Climatique Canada, 2020; Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2016, 2017). Dredging data available in a report assessing the environmental impacts of dredging in the St. Lawrence Seaway completed these data (GHD, 2019). Dredging activities for the Port of Quebec were characterized through discussions with a representative of the Port of Quebec City (Marie-Ève Lemieux, personal communication). Various reports were used to characterize maintenance dredging activities for Port Alfred (Englobe, 2016, 2017; Ministère de l’Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, 2019c), and capitalization dredging activities planned for the Port of Montreal at Contrecoeur (Agence d’évaluation d’impact du Canada, 2021; SNC Lavalin, 2017a, 2017b) and for the Port of Trois-Rivières (Stantec, 2015). Lastly, data on dredging and disposal sites were transmitted by the Essipit Innu First Nation (Bouchard, 2022). The volumes recorded were then plotted for the dredging and disposal sites. Where provided within the reports, coordinates delineating the sites considered were used. Where a single coordinate representing the geometric centre of the sites where dredging would take place was available without additional information on the exact location of the activity, an area with a radius of 100 \\(m\\) was drawn to represent the dredging or disposal area. Where the location was described, or a figure was available in the detailed reports, the dredged and disposal areas were georeferenced manually. The St. Lawrence Seaway dredging and disposal site locations were taken from a database provided by the Canadian Coast Guard (Garde côtière canadienne, 2021b). Dredging sites and dredged sediment disposal sites were characterized based on the total volume dredged in \\(m^3\\) during the period considered (Table 4.4). A total of 37 dredging sites (Table 4.5) and 29 disposal sites (Table 4.6) were characterized in the study area. It should be noted that the total volumes dredged do not correspond to the total volumes deposited since some of the disposal sites are on land and accordingly, were not included in this study. Port expansion projects for the Port of Montreal at Contrecoeur (Agence d’évaluation d’impact du Canada, 2021; SNC Lavalin, 2017a, 2017b) and for the Port of Trois-Rivières (Stantec, 2015) provided plans for capitalization dredging in the coming years. These plans were therefore identified (Table 4.4; Table 4.7). Table 4.4: Categories and description of dredging activities recorded in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river between 2001 and 2020.

Region Site name Total volumes Montréal Port de Montréal à Contrecoeur 839000 Trois-Rivières Port de Trois-Rivières 170000 The intensity of dredging (Figure 4.5), sediment disposal (Figure 4.6), and planned dredging (Figure 4.7) activities was characterized by distributing the total volumes dredged within our 1 \\(km^2\\) grid. For example, imagine a dredging activity that resulted in the extraction of 100 \\(m^3\\) of sediment over a total area of 2 \\(km^2\\) and that this site covers exactly 2 cells of our study grid. This means that the values assigned to the 1 \\(km^2\\) cells would be 50 \\(m^3\\) each. To do so, we multiplied the total volumes in each \\(j\\) cell of the study grid by the proportion of the area where dredging would take place covering cell \\(j\\): \\[I_{dredging,j} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n_j} V_{tot, k} * \\frac{A_{j,k}}{A_{tot,k}}\\] where \\(j\\) is a study grid cell, \\(k\\) is a dredging or disposal activity, \\(V_{tot}\\) is the total volume dredged or deposited during the dredging or disposal activity, \\(A\\) is the dredging area where dredging would take place \\(k\\) that intersects a \\(j\\) cell, and \\(A_{tot}\\) is the total area where the \\(k\\) dredging or disposal occurs. This formula calculates an assessment of the dredging intensity in \\(m^3\\). Since we have calculated the intensity in cells of 1 \\(km^2\\), the units of this formula are in \\(m^3 * km^{-2}\\).

The unique identifier given to the data presented in this section is: 0062. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. Environmental stress related to shipwrecks was characterized using a Canadian Coast Guard database on the distribution of vessels of concern (Garde côtière canadienne, 2021a). Most of the vessel data still need to be validated by the Canadian Coast Guard and the accuracy of the coordinates cannot be guaranteed; however, this database is the best available source of information and as such is used for the cumulative effects assessment. It will be possible to update the assessment once the data is validated by the Canadian Coast Guard. This database identifies 104 shipwrecks within the study area. The intensity of this environmental stressor was characterized using Gaussian smoothing – i.e. an interpolation method based on a normal distribution – of 3 \\(km\\) in order to identify areas potentially affected by shipwrecks and to account for the uncertainty of the shipwreck coordinates recorded by the Canadian Coast Guard. It is important to note that shipwrecks may be protected when they are considered archeological sites; in this context, shipwrecks posing no risk to the environment should instead be considered archeological areas of interest within areas of cultural, heritage and archeological interest valued components. A characterization of the archeological areas of interest is available through the Inventory of Archeological Sites in Quebec (Inventaire des sites archéologiques du Québec) of the Ministry of Culture and Communications (Ministère de la Culture et des Communications). However, we were not able to access this inventory during our assessment. Figure 4.8: Distribution of known shipwreck sites in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river 4.2.5 Shipping We thank Clément Chion and Jean-François Sénécal of the Université du Québec en Outaouais, Jeff Campagnola of Transport Canada and Samuel Turgeon of the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park for the discussions and support. The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0020, 0021, 0028, 0041, 0047. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The intensity of shipping within the study area was assessed using satellite data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) developed by Maerospace Corporation and acquired for the Canadian Space Agency (Transports Canada, 2020b, 2020a). This database contains 10729683 vessel locations (3576561 \\(\\pm\\) 1379216 observations per year) for 3347 vessels between 2017 and 2019. It is important to note that this number does not indicate the number of transits, but rather the number of geographic locations identified by the AIS. Individual location data were transformed into linear shipping segments representing individual and continuous vessel transits, assuming a straight line transit between successive locations. Vessels were identified by their Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number. All available locations were used for each vessel to plot their movements within the study area. Since vessels may enter and exit the study area, or stay in berth for longer periods of time, vessel movements were segmented into a number of individual linear segments. Segmentation was performed when two consecutive locations were over 5 hours or more than 80.5 km apart. Linear segments overlapping the land environment at a distance of over 2 km were removed from the database. This arbitrary distance of 2 km was used to remove outlier segments from the database, while still keeping segments describing coastal shipping or vessels frequenting port facilities. This segmentation resulted in 93056 linear shipping segments. Since a number of vessel types navigate the waters of the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers, we considered 9 different vessel categories to complete the characterization of shipping intensity in the study area (Table 4.8). Among the available categories, we removed the Other category due to its lack of specificity and the Fishing category since few transits were available in the database. To characterize shipping, we used an intensity index characterizing shipping in terms of single use – or transits. For each vessel category, we assessed shipping intensity within the study area by the number of shipping segments that intersect each 1 \\(km^2\\) cell of the study grid between 2017 and 2019. This index results in an assessment of shipping intensity expressed as number of vessels (\\(n\\)) per \\(km^2\\) (\\(n\\) \\(vessels\\) \\(*\\) \\(km^{-2}\\)) Despite the effort to segment and remove impossible transits, some impossible transits may still remain. For example, a very small number of transits is observed north of Île d’Orléans for cargo shipping (Figure 4.10); these transits could not be removed by the automatic segmentation that was done and the total number of transits makes it impractical to remove them manually. However, there are very few of the impossible transits in the database, so this does not affect the final results of the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities in the study area. Table 4.8: Description of the types of ships considered for the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river and their representation in the Automatic Identification System data used (Transports Canada, 2020b, 2020a).

The first deals with the intensity of marine mammal watching activities at sea on craft with a class 1 permit in 2017 (Turgeon, 2019). The data available from Turgeon (2019) provides a characterization of the number of observation vessels that went through a regular 500m x 500m grid. We resampled this grid to distribute the number of transits recorded in it within our 1 \\(km^2\\) study grid. Although this exercise is limited to the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park, this is where most of the marine mammal watching excursions take place in the study area. Figure 4.18: Distribution and intensity of shipping in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Marine mammal observation The second category deals with shipping in port areas, i.e. activities that take place near port facilities such as ports and marinas. Using the assumption that shipping activities are more prevalent in port areas, AIS data were used to quantify the number of transits through the study area port areas. The port areas were characterized using data on the location of port facilities (Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2021) and industrial port areas (Ministère de l’Économie et de l’Innovation, 2021) in Quebec. A port area zone of influence was plotted by applying a buffer zone of 200 \\(m\\). This zone is deliberately narrow in order to primarily capture vessels that frequent port areas rather than vessels transiting the St. Lawrence River waterway, especially for facilities in the fluvial environment. The number of transits through these port areas was then calculated using the AIS data. According to this approach, a total of 53386 transits were identified in port areas between 2017 and 2019. These transits were then plotted in the 1 \\(km^2\\) study grid by assigning to each cell the number of transits of the most heavily frequented overlapping port area. For example, if a grid cell was affected by a first port area with 100 transits and a second area with 200 transits, that cell was assigned a value of 200. Figure 4.19: Distribution and intensity of shipping in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Port shipping 4.2.6 Commercial fishing The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0033, 0034, 0035. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The intensity of commercial fishing activity within the study area was assessed using data from the Fisheries and Oceans Canada logbook program (Pêches et Océans Canada, 2021a, 2021b, 2021c). Although logbooks are not mandatory for all fisheries, they still provide a sufficiently exhaustive assessment of commercial fishing activity distribution and intensity in the study area. Although there is a commercial fishery in the fluvial sector and in the Saguenay River, we were unable to obtain data enabling us to characterize its distribution and intensity. The lack of data in these areas should therefore not be interpreted as an absence of commercial fishing; this gap should be addressed for a future assessment. We used data between 2010 and 2020 to characterize commercial fishing distribution and intensity in the study area. This period is characterized by 27489 fishing activities (2499 \\(\\pm\\) 336 observations per year). During this period, a total of 14 species were targeted for commercial fishing and a total of 20 different species were caught (Table 4.9). Table 4.9: Species captured by commercial fisheries in the study area (Pêches et Océans Canada, 2021a). Species in bold are the species targetted by fisheries. The unique identifiers come from a dataset providing an index of species for commercial fisheries (Pêches et Océans Canada, 2021c) Scientific name French name English name Frequency Chionoecetes opilio Crabe des neiges Snow crab 13699 Strongylocentrotus sp Oursin Sea urchins 6399 Buccinum sp Buccin Whelk 4879 Reinhardtius hippoglossoides Flétan du Groenland Greenland halibut 3206 Pandalus sp Crevette Shrimp 2662 Hippoglossoides platessoides Plie canadienne American plaice 2310 Hippoglossus hippoglossus Flétan Atlantique Atlantic halibut 1621 Urophycis tenuis Merluche blanche White hake 464 Clupea harengus Hareng Herring 393 Mactromeris polynyma Mactre de Stimpson Stimpson’s Surf clam 212 Homarus americanus Homard Lobster 186 Gadus morhua Morue Cod 169 Lophius americanus Baudroie Monkfish 122 Sebastes sp Sébaste Redfish 98 Pectinidae Pétoncle Scallop 62 Holothuroidea Concombre de mer Sea cucumber 54 Scomber scombrus Maquereau Mackerel 40 Raja sp Raie Skate 25 Cancer irroratus Crabe commun Rock crab 13 Glyptocephalus cynoglossus Plie grise Greysole (Witch) 3 Commercial fishing is carried out with a wide variety of fishing gear such as traps, trawls, dragging, gillnets and longlines. Each type of fishing gear may have different effects on the ecosystems where fishing activities take place. For example, fishing with traps has very different effects from fishing with trawls. We thus divided fishing based on their environmental effects according to the categories suggested by Halpern et al. (2008) and repeated by Beauchesne et al. (2020) for the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (Tables 4.10 and 4.11): demersal, destructive, high bycatch (DD) demersal, non-destructive, high bycatch (DNH) demersal, non-destructive, low bycatch (DNL) pelagic, high bycatch (PHB) pelagic, low bycatch (PLB) Gear can also be categorized based on its mobility. Fixed gear such as traps are left in place and have a more localized effect. Mobile gear such as trawls can be towed for several kilometres during fishing activities. We used the type of mobility to generate an area of effects for fishing activities. This approach allows for the potential uncertainty associated with fishing activity coordinates, gear mobility, and the absence of start and end coordinates for mobile gear. We used an area with a radius of 200 and 2000 metres for fixed and mobile gear fishing activities, respectively (Beauchesne et al., 2020). Types of gear were characterized using a commercial fisheries fishing gear index database together with the logbook database (Pêches et Océans Canada, 2021b). Table 4.10: Description of gear type categories with the frequency of commercial fishing activities recorded in logbooks between 2010 and 2020 (Pêches et Océans Canada, 2021a, 2021b, 2021c). Category Description Frequency Demersal, destructive, high-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using demersal fishing gear that may damage habitats or substrate, e.g. trawling and dragging. 2954 Demersal, non-destructive, low-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using demersal fishing gear with little or no bycatch and not causing habitat modification, e.g., deep-sea fishing. 6452 Demersal, non-destructive, high-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using demersal fishing gear with high bycatch and not causing habitat modification, e.g., trap and seine. 18793 Pelagic, low-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using pelagic fishing gear with little or no bycatch and not causing habitat modification, e.g., line fishing, purse seine. 8 Pelagic, high-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using pelagic fishing gear with high bycatch and not causing habitat modification, e.g., gillnet and longline. 8429 Table 4.11: Classification of gear types according to their environmental effects and mobility.

Adapted from Beauchesne et al. (2020). Type of gear Category Mobility Trap DNH Fixed Bottom trawl DD Mobile Drag DD Mobile Gillnet PHB Fixed Line fishing PLB Fixed Longline PHB Fixed Diving DNL Fixed Purse seine PLB Fixed Danish or Scottish seine DNH Fixed Shoreline seine DNH Fixed Trap DNH Fixed Jigger PLB Fixed To characterize fishing intensity (\\(I_{peche}\\)), we assessed the total frequency of fishing activities during the period considered (2010 - 2020) overlapping each study grid cell: \\[I_{fishing,j} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n_j} P_{j,k}\\] where \\(j\\) is a study grid cell, \\(k\\) is a fishing activity, and \\(P_k\\) is the buffer zone surrounding each \\(k\\) fishing activity. This formula calculates fishing intensity expressed as the number of identified fishing activities. Since we have calculated the intensity within cells of 1 \\(km^2\\), the units of this formula are in number of activities (\\(n\\)) per \\(km^2\\), or \\(n * km^{-2}\\). Since buffer zones were used around each activity, it is possible that a single fishing activity is identified for more than one cell in the study grid. The total sum of activities in the study grid will therefore not equal the actual total sum of fishing activities identified in the study area.

Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. We introduced an environmental stressor to replace operational discharges on the environmental stressor side, and water quality on the valued component side. This new stressor was used to address the difficulties in characterizing these two elements initially identified as concerns by the parties involved in the project. On the operational discharge side, this decision was made due to the lack of data covering the entire study area. From a legislative perspective, vessels transiting Canadian waters must exchange any ballast water within pre-established areas called “Canada’s Designated Alternate Ballast Water Exchange Areas” (Transports Canada, 2021a, 2021b). However, the area closest to the study area is located at the entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, meaning it does not affect the study area covered by our assessment (Figure 4.25). Data specific to operational discharges from vessels is apparently available for only a small proportion of the Canadian fleet operating in the study area and would have triggered a considerable data capture effort. As such, these data were not considered in the assessment. Figure 4.25: Location of Canada’s designated alternate ballast water exchange areas relative to the position of the study area for the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river. On the water quality side, this decision was made due to the difficulty of attributing variations in water quality specifically to marine vessel activities. There are many other factors that influence water quality in coastal, aquatic and marine environments, and differentiating these effects was beyond the scope of this pilot project. More details are available in the section on water quality. As in Halpern et al. (2019), marine pollution was characterized by combining environmental stressors related to marine vessel activities. This choice assumes that water quality is more at risk from shipping activities and the resulting pollution via operational discharges, gas leaks, waste discharges, etc. In the absence of exhaustive data on operational discharges and the difficulty of establishing a direct link between water quality and cumulative marine vessel activities, we used the marine pollution index as a proxy to identify the environments most at risk from pollution from marine vessel activities. The marine pollution index is obtained by combining the relative intensity of all stressors directly associated with shipping activities, i.e. anchorage sites, dredging activities, shipping-related activities and commercial fishing. Characterization of the accidental spills is not included since it has already been explained in detail in the issue of toxic spills in the environment rather than as a stressor related to regular shipping problems. The marine pollution intensity (\\(I_{pollution}\\)) within a cell \\(j\\) is the sum of the intensity of selected environmental stressors normalized between 0 and 1: \\[I_{pollution,j} = \\frac{1}{|S|} \\sum_{s \\in S} I_{s,j}\\] where \\(|S|\\) is the number of environmental stressors considered, \\(s\\) are the individual environmental stressors, and \\(I_{s,j}\\) is the relative intensity of the stressor \\(s\\) within cell \\(j\\). Figure 4.26: Distribution and intensity of marine pollution in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Marine pollution 4.3 Valued components Characterization of valued components in the study area resulted in the description of 4 valued components divided into 77subcategories that are considered for the marine vessel activities cumulative effects assessment (Table 4.12). The subcategories were identified primarily by the availability and accessibility of data for the biophysical valued components (i.e. bank integrity, habitats, and marine mammals); thus, they should not be considered an exhaustive representation of the diversity of valued component subcategories. In the case of cultural, heritage and archeological areas of interest, the categories identified correspond to the data reported by various First Nations, but should not be interpreted as an exhaustive representation of First Nations land use (see section 4.3.5.1 for more details). Most of the data were integrated into the study grid as presence-absence; continuous quantitative characterization was performed for marine mammals only. The approach used is described in the section specific to marine mammals. The following sections present the data and results of the data integration enabling us to characterize the valued components in the study area.

The habitats considered are those for which data have been open and accessible from the federal and provincial platforms Open Government, Données Québec and the St. Lawrence Global Observatory, or data shared by various departments/ministries and partners. This data search enabled us to characterize 21 habitat types within the study area (Table 4.13). The habitats were characterized as presence-absence in the study grid.

The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0009, 0010. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. Spawning sites are environments critical to the maintenance of fish populations; indeed, disturbances to these sites, or to species behaviour during the spawning period, can have major impacts on fish population dynamics. Similarly, feeding and protection sites for early life stages of fish (e.g. larvae, fry, juveniles) are much more susceptible to disturbances to their habitat. These sites, called nursery areas, are thus critical to fish survival. This means that the protection of spawning and nursery sites is of major importance since they constitute a bottleneck for fish population dynamics. The data used to characterize spawning and nursery areas come from an in situ observation data integration exercise covering the period from 1974 to 2019 [Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs (2020); Table 4.14]. The identified spawning and nursery sites aggregate data for 71 and 49 fish species, respectively, and cover an area of approximately 275 and 230 \\(km^2\\) within the study area. The data aggregate confirmed or potential spawning and nursery sites where habitats were deemed suitable for fish spawning or rearing. Therefore, it is likely that these data are partial and should not be considered an exhaustive description of spawning and nursery sites in the study area. The data are composed of points and polygons. We added a 100 \\(m\\) buffer zone around the points, and then incorporated the presence of spawning sites within our 1 \\(km^2\\) study grid. It should be noted that the data used covers only the fluvial portion of the study area; additional data should be added to properly characterize the entire study area.

The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0043, 0058. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The data used to characterize sites of importance to birds came from two separate sources that were inserted into the study grid on a presence-absence basis. The first database, which describes the location of bird colonies, is called the Computerized Database of Quebec Seabirds [CDQS; Rail and Chapdelaine (2002); Environnement et Changement Climatique Canada (2021)]. This database was compiled and is updated by the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) for the Quebec region. The CDQS contains information on the location of seabird colonies and their nesting sites for the following families: Gaviidae (i.e. loons), Hydrobatidae (i.e. petrels), Sulidae (i.e. gannets/boobies), Phalacrocoracidae (i.e. cormorants), Laridae (i.e. seagulls, gulls, terns), Alcidae (i.e. guillemots, penguins, puffins), and the common eider (i.e. Anatidae). For our analysis, we considered only the location of the various colonies available through the CDQS without considering individual species in order to identify the locations that are home to seabird colonies. We also used data from the year 2000 onward only. Our study area included 113 sites with a total area of 198.65 \\(km^2\\). The second database identified Important Bird Areas [IBAs; Oiseaux Canada (2015); Études d’oiseaux Canada (2015)]. IBAs are identified based on information on threatened bird species, sites with significant bird populations, or range-restricted species. Internationally accepted assessment criteria are used to identify IBAs. Our study area covers 41 IBA sites with a total area of 1701.26 \\(km^2\\). It is important to note that these sites are land environments, meaning that they do not properly capture aquatic and marine use environments associated with these sites of importance. Extrapolation of a marine use area based on variables such as the species range and number of individuals would enable us to address this gap (e.g. Lieske et al., 2020). However, it was not possible to conduct this type of analysis as part of this pilot project. Figure 4.29: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Birds 4.3.1.2 Endangered wildlife and plant species The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0059, 0060. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. A number of species with a precarious status frequent the waters and banks of the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers. In order to capture the sensitive nature of these species and incorporate them into our analysis, we considered the locations where these species have been historically sighted in the study area. The data used to characterize habitats for special status species were prepared by the Quebec Natural Heritage Data Centre (Centre de données sur le patrimoine naturel du Québec) [CDPNQ; Centre de données sur le patrimoine naturel du Québec (2021a); Centre de données sur le patrimoine naturel du Québec (2021b)]. These data contain occurrences that designate a territory that is or was home to special status species. We removed historical sightings from the database, as well as species that were extirpated or had not been sighted recently, i.e., since the year 2000. Lastly, we considered susceptible, vulnerable and threatened species. This resulted in a total of 37 species and 423 sites for wildlife species, and 64 species and 224 sites for plant species (Table 4.15). Refer to Appendix 4 and Appendix 5 for the lists of special status wildlife and plant species, respectively. Table 4.15: Number of species and total area of sites of importance for special status wildlife and floristic species in the study area (Centre de données sur le patrimoine naturel du Québec, 2021a, 2021b). Type Status Number of species Area \\(km^2\\) Wildlife Threatened 6 921.07 Wildlife Susceptible 20 325.99 Wildlife Vulnerable 11 1459.75 Plant Threatened 10 4.45 Plant Susceptible 49 8.73 Plant Vulnerable 5 1.59 These sites of importance for special status species were integrated into the study grid as presence-absence based on status in order to identify sites that are home to susceptible, vulnerable or threatened wildlife or plant species. This means that the integrated data do not discriminate between the different species considered; rather, they provide a spatial delineation of areas frequented by special status species. This results in 6 distinct categories of sites. Figure 4.30: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Susceptible wildlife species Figure 4.31: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Vulnerable wildlife species Figure 4.32: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Threatened wildlife species Figure 4.33: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Susceptible plant species Figure 4.34: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Vulnerable plant species Figure 4.35: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Threatened plant species 4.3.1.3 Natural environments 4.3.1.3.1 Eelgrass The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0001, 0002, 0003. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. Eelgrass (Zostera marina) forms complex, important habitats that can reduce currents, reduce predation and erosion, and contribute to primary production (Cimon et al., 2021; Hemminga and Duarte, 2000). The spatial distribution of eelgrass within the study area was described by integrating three different databases. The first database is the most complete and comes from a DFO literature review for James Bay, Baie des Chaleurs, and the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence covering the period from 1987 to 2009 (Pêches et Océans Canada, 2009). This literature review brings together data on eelgrass distribution from 24 different resources; it includes 226 sites over an area of 28.58 \\(km^2\\) in the study area. Two local databases providing additional information on eelgrass in the study area completed these data. The first is from an eelgrass restoration project in Anse de Pointe-au-Père in Rimouski that provides information on 7 sites covering an area of &lt; 1 \\(km^2\\) (Bois et al., 2018); the second is from a similar exercise in Baie de Mitis and provides information on 3 sites covering an area of &lt; 1 \\(km^2\\) (Bachand and Joubert, 2014; Comité ZIP du Sud-de-l’Estuaire, 2012). These three databases were integrated into the study grid on a presence-absence basis. Figure 4.36: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Eelgrass 4.3.1.3.2 Floodplains The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0013, 0014. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The characterization of floodplains in the study area was done by combining data from the Flood Risk Areas Database [BDZI; Ministère de l’Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques (2020)] and data on the presence of floodplains prepared by the regional county municipalities (Ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation, 2020). These databases provide the delineation of coastal areas at risk of flooding in Quebec. Figure 4.37: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Floodplains 4.3.1.3.3 Coastal environments The unique identifier given to the data presented in this section is: 0017. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The characterization of coastal environments comes from the bank characterization exercise in the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence River conducted by Patrick Lajeunesse’s team at Université Laval. This exercise was used to characterize the bank integrity valued component (Bernier et al., 2020; Bernier et al., 2021); this characterization is therefore available solely for the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence. This database provides a characterization of the types of coasts we use as habitats in our assessment. A total of 5 coastal environments were considered for the assessment (Table 4.13): Soft without cliff Rocky without bluff Rocky without cliff Beach terrace Fluvial terrace These environments were mapped using high-resolution mapping approaches combining the data from land surveys, remote sensing, and local community knowledge (Bernier et al., 2020; Bernier et al., 2021).

Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. Wetlands are a link between aquatic and land environments, are home to an abundance of wildlife and plants, provide critical habitat during the life cycle of multiple species, and are critical habitats for many species at risk. Wetlands provide essential ecosystem services such as protecting shorelines from erosion, improving water quality, and storing carbon; they are also widely used for cultural and recreational activities such as hunting and tourism (Clarkson et al., 2013). Wetlands encompass a significant diversity of habitat types, ranging from shallow water to swamp, with an increasing proportion of shrubs. The wetlands were characterized using a mapping of potential wetlands in Quebec (Ministère de l’Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, 2019b, 2019a). This database provides a mapping of wetlands for all of Quebec, classified in broad types: shallow water, marsh, swamp and peatbog (Table 4.13). A general category for uncategorized wetlands is also available. Wetlands occupy a total area of 516.34 \\(km^2\\) within the study area (Table 4.13). Figure 4.43: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Shallow water Figure 4.44: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Marshes Figure 4.45: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Swamps Figure 4.46: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Wetland 4.3.1.3.5 Mollusk beds The unique identifier given to the data presented in this section is: 0057. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The data used to characterize the mollusk beds in the study area were taken from a description of surf clam (Mactromeris polynyma) stocks in coastal environments in Quebec (Pêches et Océans Canada, 2019a; Trottier and Goudreau, 2015). The data provide the delimitation of known and commercially harvested deposits, both historically or currently, for the entire Quebec region of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence. Figure 4.47: Distribution of habitats in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Mollusk beds 4.3.2 Bank integrity We thank Patrick Lajeunesse and Jean-François Bernier at Université Laval for the discussions and support. The unique identifier given to the data presented in this section is: 0017. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The bank integrity valued component was characterized using geospatial data from a recent bank characterization exercise in the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence River by Patrick Lajeunesse’s team at Université Laval (Bernier et al., 2020; Bernier et al., 2021). This characterization was conducted using a high-resolution mapping approach to spatially position, characterize and assess natural and artificial banks’ susceptibility to erosion; this was done using a combination of data from land surveys, remote sensing, and local community knowledge (Bernier et al., 2020; Bernier et al., 2021). The geospatial data from this project provide a characterization of bank erosion susceptibility by classifying their state in a three-level erosion index (EI; Figure 2 in Bernier et al., 2021): Active (EI = 2): Apparent erosion or vegetation cover &lt; 25% Semi-vegetated (EI = 1): Apparent erosion or vegetation cover of 25 to 75% Stable or vegetated (EI = 0): No apparent signs of erosion, and vegetation cover &gt; 75% or presence of a protective structure For our study, we consider only those banks that have apparent signs of erosion, i.e., banks with an EI &gt; 0. We also distinguish between natural and artificial banks; this distinction is made to separate the effects of shipping on natural banks, which have a higher ecological value than artificial banks. Combining the condition of the banks as described in Bernier et al. (2020) and Bernier et al. (2021) and the degraded state of the artificialities thus results in four categories of banks susceptible to the effects of erosion (Table 4.16). Table 4.16: Categories of bank segments sensitive to erosion according to their artificiality and their erosion index (EI) considered for the CEA analysis and their total length in \\(km\\) within the bank characterization data of the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence River (Bernier et al., 2020; Bernier et al., 2021) Categories Length (km) Artificial - Semi-vegetated (EI = 1) 239.77 Artificial - Active (EI = 2) 55.57 Natural - Semi-vegetated (EI = 1) 390.91 Natural - Active (EI = 2) 257.64 These four categories were then incorporated into the grid to assess the presence of the various categories of erosion-sensitive banks within the study area. It is important to note that since this valued component has only been identified for the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence, no characterization has been done for the estuary and the Saguenay River. However, a similar characterization was recently published through the Coastal Resilience Project Projet Résilience côtière led by Pascal Bernatchez’s team at the Université du Québec à Rimouski. 4.3.2.1 Artificial banks Figure 4.48: Distribution of coastlines sensitive to erosion in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Artificial - Semi-vegetated (EI = 1) Figure 4.49: Distribution of coastlines sensitive to erosion in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Artificial - Active (EI = 2) 4.3.2.2 Natural banks Figure 4.50: Distribution of coastlines sensitive to erosion in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Natural - Semi-vegetated (EI = 1) Figure 4.51: Distribution of coastlines sensitive to erosion in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Natural - Active (EI = 2) 4.3.3 Marine mammals We thank Sonia Giroux of the Marine Mammal Observation Network (Réseau d’observation de mammifères marins, ROMM) and Aurélie Cosandey-Godin of WWF-Canada for their discussions and support. The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0027, 0054. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The characterization of marine mammal distribution in the study area was taken from the second edition of a guidebook published for mariners who frequent the Northwest Atlantic (Le WWF-Canada et le Réseau d’observation de mammifères marins, 2021a). The purpose of this guide is to inform mariners on the problem of collisions between vessels and whales, how to minimize such incidents, the various species of whales and leatherback turtles in the area and where they might be present, and on areas where heightened vigilance is required. This guide provides distribution maps for nine species of marine mammals that frequent the Northwest Atlantic (Le WWF-Canada et le Réseau d’observation de mammifères marins, 2021a, 2021b). These species were selected because of their conservation status and their known risk of collision with vessels. Distribution maps were assessed by integrating 14 separate datasets from scientific and opportunistic sightings (Table 4.17; Le WWF-Canada et le Réseau d’observation de mammifères marins (2021c)). Sighting data covering the period 2010-2015 and geographic boundaries of \\(40^o\\) to \\(55^o\\) N and -72\\(^o\\) to -48\\(^o\\) W were selected to create the maps shared in the guide. The study area was divided into a regular 0.05\\(^o\\) x 0.05\\(^o\\) grid. For each species, the number of sightings recorded in 14 available databases was assessed for each cell of the study grid. A Gaussian smoothing – i.e. an interpolation method based on a normal distribution – of 0.2\\(^o\\) was then applied to the grid. The values obtained in each cell were normalized by the total number of sightings for a species; the value in a cell therefore represents the proportion of the total number of sightings per species within the study area. Lastly, a log transformation was then applied to minimize the effect of extreme values on the resulting maps. Caveats accompany these maps and are reported verbatim in this report: Sighting effort was not quantified and varies considerably in time and space. The data represent the relative occurrence of reported sightings rather than the actual density or abundance of the species. The quality of some of the sighting data is unknown. Sightings are reported from individuals with varying degrees of expertise in identifying marine mammals.

For our study, we resampled the distribution maps produced (Le WWF-Canada et le Réseau d’observation de mammifères marins, 2021b) to integrate them into our 1 \\(km^2\\) study grid using the average value of the guide grid cells that intersect each cell in our grid. The values were then normalized between 0 and 1 by dividing each value by the maximum value observed within the grid for each species. The resulting values can be interpreted as the relative density of marine mammal sightings, with values of 0 representing a low relative density and a value of 1 a high relative density. To complete this characterization of marine mammals, we used data from the Marine Mammal Observation Network [MMON; Réseau d’observation de mammifères marins (2021)] available on the St. Lawrence Global Observatory website (https://ogsl.ca/bio/?lg=en). This database is made up of marine mammal sightings recorded by member observers who have been trained by MMON; the sightings are reported by the public and systematically collected by the MMON team, which then validates these sightings. More information about the program is available on a dedicated page on the SLGO website. This database contains nearly 50,000 marine mammal sightings of 21 different species between 1996 and 2021 (Réseau d’observation de mammifères marins, 2021). Of these, we selected data for the period from 2000 to 2021 for species not described in the guide that had more than 50 unique sightings. We applied the same methodology described for the guide to characterize the distribution of four additional species frequenting the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers: harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), harbour seal (Phoca vitulina), harp seal (Phoca groenlandica) and grey seal (Halichoerus grypus; Table 4.18). It is important to note that the resulting distribution maps for these species are not informed by a process and amount of data similar to what was used to create the marine industry guide (Le WWF-Canada et le Réseau d’observation de mammifères marins, 2021a). As with the maps created from Guide data, the resulting values can be interpreted as the relative density of marine mammal sightings, with values of 0 representing a low relative density and a value of 1 a high relative density. An additional caveat must also accompany these data: A lack of data in a sector must not be interpreted as an absence of marine mammals. There are currently no data available on marine mammal traffic for some sectors and some periods of the year.

However, water quality is affected by a suite of multiple factors including agriculture, air pollution, and sewage discharge (Sasakova et al., 2018). In the fluvial sector, water quality appears to be affected primarily by land use; proximity to a large city or agriculture directly impact water quality (Vigil, 2003). Water quality is also greatly affected by the large amount of farmland draining into Lake St. Pierre(Goyette et al., 2016; Hudon and Carignan, 2008). Marine vessel activities are generally not cited as a significant potential source of pollution affecting water quality (Butts and Shackleford, 1992). While water quality remains a valid concern, it is difficult to link water quality measures specifically to marine vessel activities. As such, we consider that a characterization of water quality as part of a sectoral cumulative effects assessment focused on marine vessel activities would likely risk inappropriately assigning responsibility to a sector of activity. To address this issue, we decided instead to adopt an alternative approach to consider the risks to water quality associated with marine vessel activities. The authors of the study Halpern et al. (2019) considered water quality as a marine pollution stressor instead. This stressor was described by combining the various individual stressors related to marine vessel activities, i.e. shipping and port activities in their case. We have thus opted for a similar approach and consider marine pollution as an environmental stressor, replacing the water quality valued component. Please refer to the section on environmental stressors for a description of the marine pollution stressor. 4.3.5 Areas of cultural, heritage and archeological interest The St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers constitute a system of major cultural, heritage and archeological importance for the First Nations and the coastal communities. Areas of cultural, heritage and archeological interest were therefore identified as a valued component to be considered in the pilot project to assess the cumulative effects of marine vessel activities. The areas of interest characterized are mainly provided by the First Nations, as well as heritage sites listed in public registers and protected areas in the region. This results in a total of 43 distinct categories of areas of interest (Table 4.19). Data characterizing the areas of interest were incorporated directly into the study grid as presence-absence. The following sections describe the data used to develop a profile of cultural, heritage and archeological areas of interest in the study area. Table 4.19: Categories of identified areas of cultural, heritage and archeological interest for the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river Areas of interest Categories Mi’kmaq and Maliseet Aboriginal Fisheries Management Association Commercial fishing Traditional fishing Innu Nation of Essipit Access to the waterbody Tourist activities Migratory bird hunting Seal hunting Culture and heritage Commercial fishing Traditional fishing Huron-Wendat Nation Ritual or social activities Archeology Hunting Species at risk History Land use Fishing Harvesting of vegetation Toponymy Mohawk Nation of Kahnawà:ke Waterfowl hunting Culture and heritage Shipping Shoreline fishing Open water fishing Harvesting of vegetation Seigneurie du Sault-Saint-Louis W8banaki Nation Game hunting Migratory bird hunting Picking and gathering vegetation Shipping Fishing Access to territory problems Sites with archeological potential Archeological sites Cultural sites Overnight sites Essential sites Fur trapping Activity areas Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation Port development Beluga whale watching Commercial fishing Public Protected areas Heritage sites 4.3.5.1 Areas of interest to First Nations In this pilot project, particular importance was assigned to areas of interest to First Nations. Marine vessel activities may affect the conditions that underlie the exercise of First Nations’ Indigenous rights, especially in terms of access to resources and the land. A collaborative process was therefore initiated with Indigenous nations who conduct activities in the study area now or have done in the past. The following participating Indigenous Nations provided data Huron-Wendat Nation Innu Nation of Essipit Mohawk Nation of Kahnawà:ke Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation W8banaki Nation An information sharing protocol was developed in cooperation with the participating First Nations. This protocol provides a framework for data use that supports First Nations OCAP principles in research: PCAP\\(^{MD}\\) (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession). Applying these principles serves to protect First Nations’ information and knowledge assets. These principles state that a community, a nation, or a group owns information collectively. These principles apply to all types and fields of research conducted on First Nations lands and/or that concern First Nations. One-on-one meetings were held with representatives of participating First Nations to present the project and discuss the needs for information in order to incorporate the areas of interest into the cumulative effects assessment. The participating First Nations subsequently proceeded to gather cartographic and non-cartographic information representing their respective Nations’ areas of interest. Our research team therefore did not collect any data; this work was carried out by the participating First Nations, who subsequently sent us data designating areas of interest to be considered in the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities. An open access cartographic atlas developed by the Mi’kmaq and Maliseet Aboriginal Fisheries Management Association [MMAFMA; Arsenault et al. (2017)] also provided land use data for the Gespeg Mi’kmaq, Gesgapegiag Mi’kmaq and Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nations. The areas of interest are generally identified through exercises to integrate knowledge from other studies conducted with First Nations members. The areas of interest identified by the participating First Nations can be broadly classified into 9 main categories: Ritual or social activities Hunting Culture and heritage Land use Commercial fishing Traditional fishing Harvesting of vegetation Archeological sites Tourism The areas of interest identified by the Nations have been kept separate rather than integrated into a single layer by broad area of interest category, despite Nations identifying similar categories. For example, although most Nations identified areas of interest for hunting, the areas identified by individual First Nations remained separate for the cumulative effects assessment. This approach is intended to respect the independence of each Nation and to assign greater importance to an environment if it is identified by more than one Nation. This is the case of Lake St. Pierre, among other areas, which is identified as an area of interest by more than one participating Nation. Each Nation organized and categorized its own areas of interest; these categories have been kept as reported despite similarities between the categories having been identified among the participating First Nations. There has been no attempt to harmonize categories among the First Nations. This choice was made in order to avoid distorting the information transmitted by the Nations. In addition, since the areas identified by the various Nations remain separate for the assessment, harmonizing the categories of areas of interest would not have affected the assessment. We thus decided to keep the wording used in the data transmitted. There are a few points that must be kept in mind regarding areas of interest to First Nations. First, the information reported cannot be considered an exhaustive description of the areas of interest for all members of Indigenous Nations; the engagement process with the members of each Nation from which the information was derived was limited, and the information was integrated only in the context of the project assessing the cumulative effects of marine vessel activities. The areas of interest identified come from other studies whose data were integrated to meet the objectives of this study. In addition, not all First Nations with an area of interest in the study area were able to be involved in the project. For example, despite the areas of interest for the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation being included, a collaborative process similar to that carried out with the other Nations could not be established; the socio-cultural data of the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation could therefore not be included in our assessment. The characterization of the areas of interest cannot be deemed exhaustive for all the First Nations in the region being studied. Second, the First Nations’ connection to place goes beyond a strictly utilitarian and functional perspective; this perspective is difficult to capture through a mapping of areas of interest, which has the effect of objectifying them. This means it is important to consider that the areas of interest identified are part of a broader cultural and ecological context as opposed to a mere geographical location. Third, the concept of First Nations land use goes beyond mere use. Indeed, Indigenous customary activities are aboriginal rights protected by section 35(1) of the Canadian Constitution. The Constitution Act, 1982 affirms the existing aboriginal and treaty rights. However, most of these rights remain undefined and the Royal Proclamation of 1763 states that Aboriginal peoples continue to hold any lands they have not ceded or sold. It is therefore important to distinguish these food, ritual and social activities, which are protected by the Constitution and are linked to the Nation’s subsistence, from non-native fishing, hunting and trapping which are for sport and leisure. Fourth, the spatio-temporal boundaries of the present study were raised as an important limitation in an Indigenous context since the study does not appropriately capture the evolving nature of their land occupation and use. The description of the areas of interest presented should not be interpreted as representative of the past or as a guarantee of the future. Lastly, the First Nations’ participation in this study is without prejudice to the exercise of their legal rights in their respective traditional territories to which their stewardship rights and responsibilities apply and which are based on the application of a broader ecosystemic approach. This means that the identified areas of interest must be interpreted in the broader context of these rights and responsibilities. The following sections briefly describe the data shared by the participating First Nations and the data accessible through open platforms. 4.3.5.1.1 Mi’kmaq and Maliseet Aboriginal Fisheries Management Association We thank Lisa M. Arsenault for the discussions and support. The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0022, 0023. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The Mi’kmaq and Maliseet Aboriginal Fisheries Management Association (MMAFMA) has developed a cartographic atlas describing various sites and uses related to commercial and traditional fishing that are of importance to the Gesgapegiag, Gespeg and Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nations (Arsenault et al., 2017). The Atlas describes commercial fishing targeting nine different species: whelk (Buccinum sp.), sea cucumber (Holothuria sp.), rock crab (Cancer irroratus), snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio), northern shrimp (Pandalus sp.), Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), lobster (Homarus americanus), and sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus sp.) in the St. Lawrence Estuary (Arsenault et al., 2017; Racine and Arsenault, 2017). Since most of these fisheries are conducted by the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation, these data are used to describe that Nation’s commercial fisheries (see section 4.3.5.1.6). Since the Gespeg Mi’kmaq Nation also has a commercial northern shrimp fishery in the St. Lawrence Estuary, we selected this fishery from the Atlas data. The Atlas also identifies the Rimouski, Métis and Matane rivers as sites of importance to Atlantic salmon fishing [Salmo salar; Arsenault et al. (2017)]. We added a 3 \\(km\\) buffer zone at the mouth of these three rivers to capture their presence as an area of interest for the assessment.

The unique identifier given to the data presented in this section is: 0024. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The data transmitted by the Innu Nation of Essipit are an integration of data from various sources (Bouchard and Tremblay, 2021): Inventory of archeological sites in Quebec. Innu-Aitun follow-up, 2004 to 2018, Essipit. History of the commercial (snow crab, sea urchin) and food (Atlantic halibut) fisheries, 1996 to 2020, Essipit. Atlas of coastal and marine uses of the St. Lawrence by the Innu of the North Shore, Agence Mamu Innu Kaikusseht, 2019. Collection of data on the harvesting of migratory birds in seven Innu communities of the North Shore, Agence Mamu Innu Kaihusseht, 2014 The result of the integration of these data provides the location of areas of interest located in the St. Lawrence Estuary and the Saguenay River. These areas are divided into seven categories: Migratory bird hunting Seal hunting Commercial fishing Traditional fishing Tourist activities Access to the water Culture and heritage These categories of area of interest are used in the marine vessel activities cumulative effects assessment in the study area. It is important to note that the original data used cover a wider area than the study area of this assessment, but were intersected and limited to our study area.

Nadeau and Mario Gros-Louis for their discussions and support. The unique identifier given to the data presented in this section is: 0055. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The data transmitted by the Huron-Wendat Nation provide the location of areas of interest mainly in the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence and the estuary, and to a lesser extent in the St. Lawrence estuary (Nation Huronne-Wendat, 2021). The areas are composed of nine themes divided into three unique categories: Contemporary sites Ritual or social activities Hunting Fishing Harvesting of vegetation Land use Ecological sites Species at risk Heritage sites Archeology History Toponymy The land use category groups together various types of areas of interest for the Huron-Wendat Nation. A general formula for designating these areas has been kept due to the sensitivity of the data included. The themes were considered as unique categories of valued components for the cumulative effects assessment. It is important to note that the original data used cover a wider area than the study area of this assessment, but were intersected and limited to our study area. 4.3.5.1.3.1 Contemporary sites Figure 4.70: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Huron-Wendat Nation - Ritual or social activities Figure 4.71: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Huron-Wendat Nation - Hunting Figure 4.72: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Huron-Wendat Nation - Fishing Figure 4.73: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Huron-Wendat Nation - Harvesting of vegetation Figure 4.74: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Huron-Wendat Nation - Land use 4.3.5.1.3.2 Ecological sites Figure 4.75: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Huron-Wendat Nation - Species at risk 4.3.5.1.3.3 Heritage sites Figure 4.76: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Huron-Wendat Nation - Archeology Figure 4.77: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Huron-Wendat Nation - History Figure 4.78: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Huron-Wendat Nation - Toponymy 4.3.5.1.4 Mohawk Nation of Kahnawà:ke We thank the Mohawk Nation of Kahnawà:ke for their participation, as well as the Mohawk Council Advisory Committee of Kahnawà:ke (Comité Consultatif du Conseil Mohawk de Kahnawà:ke) for the discussions and support. The unique identifier given to the data presented in this section is: 0032. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The data transmitted by the Mohawk Nation of Kahnawà:ke provide the location of areas of interest in the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence River in the Montreal and Lake St. Pierre area (Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke, 2021). The areas identified focus primarily on hunting, fishing and vegetation harvesting activities for a variety of important species, cultural sites, and the use of certain portions of the territory by the Nation. These areas can be divided into seven categories: Activities Waterfowl hunting Open water fishing Shoreline fishing Vegetation harvesting Sites of importance Culture and heritage Land use Seigneurie du Sault-Saint-Louis Shipping The sites making up these eight categories were used for the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities. It is important to note that the original data used cover a wider area than the study area of this assessment, but were intersected and limited to our study area. A clause accompanies the shared data, which we take the liberty of transcribing in its entirety in English: The Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke (MCK) has gathered some information from community members concerning the value and use of the St. Lawrence River in the vicinity of Kahnawà:ke. These comments have been organized according to the valued components identified for the fluvial section of the river through the Cumulative Effects of Marine Shipping by the Transport Canada team in collaboration with project partners. Therefore, the information provided is based on a limited consultation of community members, with the intent of responding to the specific parameters of this Transport Canada study only and should not be interpreted as a comprehensive study of Mohawk traditional land use or rights throughout the study area. The information provided should also not be used to replace engagement, including the gathering of traditional land use information within the context of any other future study or project. In addition, our participation in this study is without prejudice to the exercise of our jurisdictional rights to our traditional territory to which our stewardship rights and responsibilities apply and that are based on the application of a broader ecosystem-based approach. Therefore, the identification of specific areas of concern or value, including the identification of specific fish species or archeological sites of interest is to be understood within the context of these broader rights and responsibilities. Although data were provided by the Mohawk Nation of Kahnawà:ke and incorporated into the cumulative effects assessment, it was requested that maps of identified sites not be presented. For more information, please contact the Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke. The original request to remove the figures is as follows: The Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke provided information concerning some known sites of interest related to the activities mentioned above. These data were incorporated into the cumulative effects assessment however it was requested that the delineation of these areas not be shown within this report. For further information on this data, please contact the Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke 4.3.5.1.5 W8banaki Nation We thank the W8banaki Nation for their participation, as well as the Grand Council of the Waban-Aki Nation, Edgar Blanchet, Hadrien Bois and David Bernard for the discussions and support. The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0066, 0067, 0068. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. As part of this pilot project, the Grand Council of the Waban-Aki Nation (Grand Conseil de la Nation Waban-Aki, GCNWA) integrated spatialized and non-spatialized information from semi-directed individual and small group land use interviews previously conducted with members of the Nation. These studies include a sample of 33 respondents from 74 interviews. The mapping is supported by qualitative information primarily from 1) two focus group workshops held in 2016, workshop interviews held between 2019 and 2020 with women from the Nation, and 3) impact assessment analyses of port expansion projects on the Nation’s ancestral rights. This integrative work has led to the production of a report outlining the known concerns of some Nation members about environmental pressures within their territory affecting the valued components covered by our marine vessel activities cumulative effects assessment (Grand Conseil de la Nation Waban-Aki (GCNWA), 2021). The data provided by the GCNWA provide the location of areas of interest primarily in the fluvial portion of the St. Lawrence River (Grand Conseil de la Nation Waban-Aki (GCNWA), 2021). The identified sites are divided into 13 distinct categories: Contemporary land use and occupation Fishing (e.g. perch, walleye, sturgeon) Migratory bird hunting (e.g. snow geese, Canada geese) Game hunting (e.g. white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse) Trapping of furbearing species (e.g. muskrat, snowshoe hare) Harvesting and gathering of vegetation (e.g. cattail, fiddlehead) Shipping Overnight site (e.g. camps) Essential sites (e.g. baiting sites, calling sites) Activity areas (e.g. hunting area, trapping area) Problems related to the territory (e.g. site to which access has been lost) Heritage, cultural and archeological sites Cultural sites (e.g. gathering site, sacred or ritual place) Archeological sites Sites with archeological potential These categories of areas of interest are used in the marine vessel activities cumulative effects assessment in the study area. It is important to note that the original data used cover a wider area than the study area of this assessment, but were intersected and limited to our study area. 4.3.5.1.5.1 Contemporary land use and occupation Figure 4.79: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - W8banaki Nation - Fishing Figure 4.80: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - W8banaki Nation - Migratory bird hunting Figure 4.81: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - W8banaki Nation - Game hunting Figure 4.82: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - W8banaki Nation - Fur trapping Figure 4.83: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - W8banaki Nation - Picking and gathering vegetation Figure 4.84: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - W8banaki Nation - Shipping Figure 4.85: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - W8banaki Nation - Overnight sites Figure 4.86: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - W8banaki Nation - Essential sites Figure 4.87: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - W8banaki Nation - Activity areas Figure 4.88: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - W8banaki Nation - Access to territory problems 4.3.5.1.5.2 Heritage, cultural and archeological sites Figure 4.89: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - W8banaki Nation - Cultural sites Figure 4.90: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - W8banaki Nation - Archeological sites Figure 4.91: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - W8banaki Nation - Sites with archeological potential 4.3.5.1.6 Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation We thank the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation for their participation, as well as David Poissant for the discussions and support. The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0022, 0025, 0072. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. We are using data provided to us by representatives of the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation to characterize sites of importance to the commercial lobster [Homarus americanus; Première Nation Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk (2021a)] fishery. These data identify environments deemed important to fishing on the south shore of the St. Lawrence. These data were complemented with data from the MMAFMA (see section 4.3.5.1.1) on commercial fishing of whelk (Buccinum sp.), sea cucumber (Holothuria sp.), rock crab (Cancer irroratus), snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio), northern shrimp (Pandalus sp.), Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), lobster (Homarus americanus), and sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus sp.) in the St. Lawrence Estuary (Arsenault et al., 2017; Racine and Arsenault, 2017). Two areas of interest for beluga whale watching and harbour development are also considered areas of interest for the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation (Première Nation Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk, 2022). It is important to note, however, that despite the inclusion of areas of interest to the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation, a collaborative process similar to that carried out with the other Nations could not be established. This means that the socio-cultural data of the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation could not be included in our assessment. Figure 4.92: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation - Port development Figure 4.93: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation - Beluga whale watching Figure 4.94: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk Nation - Commercial fishing 4.3.5.2 Areas of public interest 4.3.5.2.1 Protected areas The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0030, 0038, 0039. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The protected areas were characterized by integrating three databases. The first database corresponds to the delineation of the different spatial management measures implemented in the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park (Agence Parcs Canada, 2021b). This database includes the delineation of regulatory spatial measures (e.g. no-shipping zones and slow-down zones) as well as voluntary spatial measures (e.g. slow-down zones and avoidance zones). The second database comes from the Government of Canada and delineates environments where management measures are recognized as other effective conservation measures by area [EMCEZ; Pêches et Océans Canada (2021e)]. Within our study area, this database shows a single protected area upstream of the Saguenay River that limits fishing activities to protect beluga habitat and to avoid resuspension of contaminated sediments. Finally, data from the Quebec register of protected areas (Registre des aires protégées au Québec) (Ministère de l’Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, 2021b) were used to complete the work. This register provides a compilation of protected areas in Quebec – identified according to the definitions of the Natural Heritage Conservation Act (NHCA; RLRQ, chapter C-61.01) or the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) – and territories of conservation importance – identified by the Ministère de l’Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques (MELCC) or an authority of the Quebec government. We removed from this database wildlife habitats, habitats of threatened or vulnerable plant species, and land reserves for protected area purposes because these categories covered the entire study area or because they were covered by other valued components. Figure 4.95: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Public - Protected areas 4.3.5.2.2 Heritage sites The unique identifiers given to the data presented in this section are: 0044, 0045. Refer to the following section and to Appendix 1 for more details on these data. The characterization of public heritage sites comes from the integration of two databases from the Ministère de la Culture et des Communications. The first database presents data on heritage sites classified by the Minister and which are part of the heritage protected under the Cultural Heritage Act [R.S.Q., c. 21; Ministère de la Culture et des Communications (2021b)]. The second database corresponds to heritage sites cited by municipalities and Indigenous communities (Ministère de la Culture et des Communications, 2021a); these sites are also part of the heritage protected under the Cultural Heritage Act. Figure 4.96: Distribution of sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river - Public - Heritage sites 4.4 Vulnerability The following sections present the data, approaches, and results of the vulnerability assessment of valued components to the environmental stressors considered for the marine vessel activities cumulative effects assessment in the study area. A general description of the vulnerability assessment in a cumulative effects assessment context is presented in section 3.2.5 of the report. 4.4.1 Plant and wildlife habitats 4.4.1.1 Natural environments Several exercises to assess the vulnerability of different habitat types to various environmental stressors have been published in Canada (e.g. Ban et al., 2010; Clarke Murray et al., 2015b, 2015a) and elsewhere in the world (Kappel et al., 2012; Teck et al., 2010). A similar process led by Fisheries and Oceans Canada is currently underway to characterize the vulnerability of West Atlantic habitats to approximately 50 stressors. Originally developed by Halpern et al. (2007) to characterize habitat vulnerability on a global scale, this approach uses exposure and sensitivity metrics to assess five ecosystem vulnerability criteria (i.e. habitats in our study): spatial scale, frequency, trophic impact, resistance, and resilience (Table 4.20). Table 4.20: Description of the five vulnerability criteria used to assess the relative vulnerability of habitats to each stressor (adapted from Teck et al., 2010). Vulnerability criterion Description Spatial scale The spatial scale (\\(km^2\\)) at which a stressor impacts the habitat, both directly and indirectly Frequency The mean annual frequency (number/year) of a stressor at a particular location within a given region Trophic impact The degree to which marine life is affected by a stressor within a given ecosystem and region (i.e., one or more species, one or more trophic levels, or an entire ecosystem) Resistance The degree (in %) to which species, trophic levels, or the natural state of an entire ecosystem is affected by the stressor Recovery time The mean time (in years) required for the affected species, trophic level(s), or entire community to return to its former natural state following disturbance caused by the stressor These allow the use of quantitative factors that provide greater transparency than the qualitative approach (Kappel et al., 2012; Teck et al., 2010). The vulnerability scores \\(\\mu\\) are the weighted sum of the five vulnerability criteria: \\[mu_{D_i,E_j} = \\sum_{k = 1,...,5} W_k * D^j_{i,k}\\] where \\(D^j_{i,k}\\) is the value of stressor \\(i\\) for criterion \\(k\\) within ecosystem \\(j\\) and \\(W_k\\) is the weight associated with criterion \\(k\\), with the sum of all weights equal to 1. The weight \\(W_k\\) is thus used to weight the value attributed to individual criteria according to their individual importance. This additive and linear model assumes that vulnerability is monotonic for all vulnerability criteria, i.e. that vulnerability increases with an increase in the value of each criterion. A transformation of the \\(W_k\\) values is required to ensure that the range of values is comparable for the different criteria. This equation ultimately generates a matrix of vulnerability scores for all stressor-ecosystem combinations. Teck et al. (2010) and Kappel et al. (2012) used expert surveys to assess the values and weights associated with each vulnerability criterion for each stressor-habitat combination. A total of 107 experts assessed the relative vulnerability of 19 habitat types to 53 environmental stressors. The resulting vulnerability matrices have been used and adapted many times since (e.g. Ban et al., 2010; Clarke Murray et al., 2015b). These vulnerability matrices also provide a starting point for our assessment; indeed, all of the environmental stressors, and a significant portion of the habitats considered for our assessment, are found in the list presented by Teck et al. (2010), Kappel et al. (2012) and Clarke Murray et al. (2015b). Specifically, we used the vulnerability matrix from Kappel et al. (2012) to inform the vulnerability assessment of habitats for which a clear match could be made, i.e., natural environments. Refer to Appendix 6 and Appendix 7 for the matches used between our study and Kappel et al. (2012) for stressors and valued components, respectively. Some habitats considered for our assessment, however, did not have a clear match with the matrix of Kappel et al. (2012). In these cases, we adopted the approach used by Clarke Murray et al. (2015b) and selected the habitat(s) presented by Kappel et al. (2012) that were most like those for which a clear match was unavailable. For example, the Kappel et al. (2012) shallow soft sediment and salt marsh habitat scores were used for mollusk beds and fluvial terraces, respectively. If a habitat under consideration could aggregate multiple Kappel et al. (2012) habitats, we instead used the average score of these habitats to obtain a vulnerability score. Vulnerability scores assigned to floodplains were thus obtained based on the average of the vulnerability scores assigned to rocky intertidal, intertidal, and salt marsh environments in the Kappel et al. (2012) matrix. Similarly, the government and research shipping category includes a significant diversity of vessel types such as military craft, patrol vessels, and scientific research vessels. The vulnerability of habitats to this type of shipping was thus assessed using the average of the scores assigned to shipping, military, research, and scientific sampling from Kappel et al. (2012). Some modifications were also made to the vulnerability scores reported by Kappel et al. (2012). First, the vulnerability values assigned to wetlands were modified to appropriately capture the fineness of the dataset available for our study. The characterized wetlands reflect the tiered nature of wetlands, with shallow water wetlands, followed by marshes, then swamps, with the potential exposure of these environments to marine-based stressors gradually decreasing. We thus decreased the vulnerability of wetlands to all stressors proportionally by a factor of 5% for marshes and 10% for swamps. We retained the Kappel et al. (2012) assessment for the wetland habitat category containing wetlands of unknown type as a precaution. Second, accidental spills were categorized to differentiate hydrocarbon spills from other types of spills, meaning that we decrease the spill vulnerability values by a factor of 10% for other spills. As with the wetlands, we kept the vulnerability value intact for spills of unknown content as a precaution. Lastly, a relative score was estimated by normalizing the total scores by the maximum observed vulnerability value among the habitats considered (i.e. 3.6) to obtain a score ranging from 0 to 1. The resulting vulnerability matrix can be consulted in Table 4.97. Figure 4.97: Relative vulnerability scores of habitats to environmental stressors. Scores are obtained from Kappel et al. (2012) and normalized between 0 and 1 using the maximum vulnerability score among habitats considered (i.e. 3.6). Original scores from Kappel et al. (2012) can be obtained by multiplying matrix values by 3.6. 4.4.1.2 Habitats of importance to wildlife and plant species The vulnerability of habitats identified for their importance to life cycles and special status species cannot be assessed using the same approach used for natural environments. These sites differ from the habitats presented above in that they are environments whose characteristics may vary, but which perform essential functions for the maintenance of certain species, or are deemed important for the conservation of certain special status species. As such, the vulnerability of these sites cannot be assessed in the same way as the assessment presented in the previous section. An alternative approach using species-based criteria rather than habitat-based criteria was used to assess their relative vulnerability to the effects of the stressors under consideration. Exercises to assess species vulnerability to the effects of stressors are less common in cumulative effects assessments, although some assessment processes do exist (e.g. Maxwell et al., 2013; O’Hara et al., 2021; Trew et al., 2019). These assessments primarily involved marine megafauna species (e.g. whales and sharks) and species at risk. However, these publications do not cover all species and stressors included in this assessment. They do provide a set of criteria for assessing species vulnerability to stressors. We used a similar process to determine the vulnerability to marine vessel activities of environments of importance to species in the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers. The criteria used to assess species vulnerability to the effects of marine vessel activities are taken from Maxwell et al. (2013): 1) the frequency of stressors, 2) whether the effect of the stressor is direct or indirect, 3) the resistance of the species to the effects of the stressor, 4) the recovery time of the species, 5) the relative effect on reproduction, and 6) the relative effect on the population (Table 4.21). We added two criteria to this list in order to consider regional particularities specific to the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers, namely 7) the status of the species and 8) whether the species is resident in the study area (Table 4.21). Table 4.21: Criteria considered for assessing the vulnerability of valued components with regard to species – i.e. - important environmental conditions for life cycles, special status species and marine mammals – to the stressors considered for the CEA of marine vessel activities in the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river. The criteria were adapted from Maxwell et al. (2013), to which species special status and residence criteria were added in order to account for the regional particularities of the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay river. Vulnerability criteria Rank Categories Description Examples Frequency 0 Never What is the frequency of the stressor? 1 Rare Infrequent, but enough to affect long-term dynamics or populations Hydrocarbon spills 2 Occasional Frequent, but irregular Toxic algae blooms 3 Annual or regular Frequent and often seasonal or periodic Leaching due to seasonal precipitation 4 Persistent More or less constant annually over a number of years or decades Persistent hypoxic zones or transportation of goods Direct or indirect effect 0 No effect How does the stressor affect individuals? 1 Distant indirect effect The effects are more than one degree away Distant trophic cascade, ecosystem degradation 2 Indirect effect The stressor affects the individual via an indirect link Prey, food resource, direct trophic link 3 Direct minor effect A direct effect that affects mechanisms other than mortality, such as metabolism, physiology or behaviour Changes in marine mammal behaviour due to marine traffic 4 Direct major effect Mortality Bycatch in fishing gear or collision with a vessel Resistance (probability of mortality) 0 No effect How likely is it that the stressor affects an individual’s mortality? 1 Low Unlikely to cause mortality (0-33%) Anthropogenic noise 2 Moderate Moderate probability of causing mortality (33-66%) Domoic acid 3 High High probability of causing mortality (66-100%) Massive reduction of food resources Recovery time (years) 1 &lt;1 How long does it take an individual to recover from exposure to the stressor? 2 1-10 3 10-100 4 &gt;100 Effect on reproduction 0 No effect How much does the stressor affect the reproduction of individuals? 1 Low Affects certain aspects (e.g. behaviour) without affecting reproductive capacities Temporary relocation of feeding grounds 2 Moderate Decreased reproductive capacities Overall reduction in resource availability resulting in reduced reproduction 3 High Direct mortality Mortality resulting in no reproduction Effect on the population 0 No effect How are the effects distributed across the population? 1 Low Affects one individual at a time Collision with a vessel 2 Moderate Affects a specific portion or a high proportion of the population Effects targeting the females in the population 3 High Affects the entire population Departure from normal temperatures associated with climate change Status of the species 0 Aucun statut Does the species have a conservation status? 1 Susceptible / Of concern Provincial status / Federal status 2 Vulnerable / Threatened 3 Threatened / Endangered Resident species 1 &gt;0 - 6 months Is the species present all year or for a period of the year? 2 6 - &lt;12 months 3 Resident The criteria used varied depending on the habitat types assessed. The frequency of environmental stressors was used for all habitats of importance to the species. The vulnerability of spawning and nursery sites considered the frequency of environmental stressors and the effects on reproduction and population. The vulnerability of habitats of importance to seabirds was assessed by considering the frequency of stressors and the effects on populations. Lastly, the vulnerability of habitats of importance to special status species was assessed using the frequency of environmental stressors, effects on populations, and species status. It should be noted that the vulnerability of sites of importance to special status wildlife and plant species was considered in the same way. Although wildlife and plant species respond differently to environmental stressors, our assessment uses occurrences of species at risk as a proxy for vulnerable environments rather than a species-specific assessment. The general characterization used did not allow us to differentiate between species, so we focused on criteria specific to species status. For each combination of valued component \\(CV_i\\) and stressor \\(S_j\\), the final vulnerability score \\(\\mu_{CV_i, S_j}\\) is obtained from the sum of the scores for each criterion: \\[mu_{CV_i, S_j} = \\sum_{k \\in K} C^i_{j,k}\\] where \\(C^i_{j,k}\\) is the value of the valued component \\(i\\) for the stressor \\(j\\) and the criterion \\(k\\), and \\(K\\) are the set of criteria considered to assess the vulnerability of the valued component \\(i\\). Lastly, a relative score was assessed by normalizing the total scores by the maximum observed vulnerability value per habitat group assessed using the same criteria. Spawning and nursery sites were the first group, seabirds the second, and special status species the third. The final vulnerability scores are available in Table 4.98 and the individual criteria assessment tables per habitat category are available in Appendix 8. Figure 4.98: Relative vulnerability scores of habitats of importance to wildlife and plant species to environmental stressors. 4.4.2 Bank integrity Several environmental stressors of anthropogenic and natural origins are added to the natural geomorphological mechanisms that govern the dynamics of bank erosion. With respect to anthropogenic pressures, the factors exerting a particular impact on bank erosion are: wave action caused by marine traffic, flow management, dredging, bank artificialization, and coastal infrastructure and activities (Bernier et al., 2020; Bernier et al., 2021). Climate change may also impact bank erosion by altering flood dynamics and water flows (Bernier et al., 2020; Bernier et al., 2021). In our assessment, shipping and dredging are the stressors related to marine vessel activities with an established link to bank erosion. This means that we considered bank vulnerability to erosion from the other environmental stressors identified in our study to be zero. The vulnerability scores assigned to shipping and dredging were directly informed by the data used to characterize bank integrity in the study area, which provides a characterization of bank susceptibility to erosion by dividing bank state into three erosion index levels, with the third level identifying banks that are not vulnerable to erosion (Bernier et al., 2020; Bernier et al., 2021). We also distinguished between natural and artificial banks, assigning a higher value to natural banks (see Full Picture of the Study Area). We can thus classify the categories of banks based on the magnitude of their vulnerability, for which we assigned a relative vulnerability score decreasing by 10% intervals: Natural - Active (EI = 2): 1. Artificial - Active (EI = 2): 0.9. Natural - Semi-vegetated (EI = 1): 0.8. Artificial - Semi-vegetated (EI = 1): 0.7. No comparison was made to distinguish the vulnerability of the banks to shipping from that of dredging; we instead opted to assign them similar vulnerability values (Table 4.99). Figure 4.99: Relative vulnerability scores of coastlines to erosion from the effects of environmental stressors. 4.4.3 Marine mammals We thank Sonia Giroux of the Marine Mammal Observation Network and Marie Guilpin of the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research for their discussions and support. The previous section presents the different criteria used to characterize species vulnerability to environmental stressors. Vulnerability of marine mammals was assessed using the set of criteria presented in table 4.21 and the equation presented in the previous section. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) federal statuses were used to determine the status of marine mammal species. The final vulnerability scores are available in Table 4.100 and the individual criteria assessment tables by marine mammal species are available in Appendix 9. Figure 4.100: Relative vulnerability scores of marine mammals to environmental stressors. 4.4.4 Areas of cultural, heritage and archeological interest The areas of interest are mainly sites identified by the First Nations. These areas of interest represent the use and occupation of the territory by the various participating Nations and have already been deemed important to the project on the basis that marine vessel activities may affect the conditions that underlie the exercise of First Nations’ Indigenous rights. Determining the relative vulnerability of an area of interest to an Indigenous Nation as done for the other valued components (see previous sections) would be akin to assigning a higher or lower value to sites by comparing them to each other. However, assigning a value to an area of interest is a particularly complex, if not impossible, exercise. For example, is a hunting site more valuable than an archeological site? As noted by the Grand Council of the Waban-Aki Nation (Grand Conseil de la Nation Waban-Aki (GCNWA), 2021): […] it is impossible to appropriately map the values assigned to particular sites or activities. The importance of a site depends on a multitude of factors. For example, although not visited on a regular basis, some places are associated with stories or legends, with the history or collective imagination of the Nation, with archeological or sacred sites, etc. In this regard, and after discussions with a number of representatives of the participating First Nations, we deemed that it would be inappropriate to assign a vulnerability score to the sites identified in the context of this pilot project. Instead, we have assigned a vulnerability value of 1 for all the identified areas of interest. This does not mean that all areas of interest are automatically considered affected by marine vessel activities for the cumulative effects assessment. Rather, the cumulative effects assessment becomes the result of intersecting the distribution and intensity of environmental stressors with the distribution of areas of interest, i.e. the exposure of areas of interest to environmental stressors. This means that an area of interest exposed to several high-intensity stressors would be more affected than an area of interest that is not similarly exposed to the environmental stressors considered. Using a vulnerability value of 1 for all areas of interest has an effect, however, on the overall assessment of cumulative effects including all valued components; areas of interest receive a maximum vulnerability score, which is not the case for the other valued components considered in this assessment (see previous sections). In relative terms, the vulnerability of the areas of interest is thus considered higher than most of the other valued components included in the assessment. This necessarily imposes a bias “in favour” of the areas of interest for the overall assessment. However, the results of the assessment are presented and discussed by individual valued components to overcome this bias. To ensure continuity for the vulnerability of areas of interest, a vulnerability value of 1 was also assigned to areas of public interest, i.e. protected areas and heritage sites.

We begin by presenting and discussing results from the partial models, i.e. cumulative stressors, cumulative valued components, and cumulative exposure; these results provide a starting point for interpreting the cumulative effects assessment results by exploring smaller portions of the full assessment. We then present the results of the full cumulative effects assessment based on the assessment general model. 5.1 Cumulative stressors and hotspots The method used to obtain the following results is presented in section 3.2.2.1 of the report. The assessment of cumulative stressors in the study area indicates that the entire study area is exposed to at least low levels of environmental stressors related to marine vessel activities (Figures 5.1 and 5.2). Large port cities and the waterway are particularly exposed to stressors. In the fluvial sector, the Quebec City, Trois-Rivières, Sorel-Tracy, and Montreal regions are environments at risk from the effects of stressors; in the marine sector, the regions most at risk are the south of Île d’Orléans, the mouth of the Saguenay River, Rivière-du-Loup, Rimouski, Matane, and Baie-Comeau. Since the fluvial sector is much narrower than the marine sector, environmental stressors are more concentrated there than in the marine sector, where stressors are widespread but spatially diffuse. All of these observations are reinforced by the results of cumulative hotspots, which allow for a more precise delineation of the environments most exposed to the accumulation of high-intensity stressors (Figure 5.3). The most prevalent environmental stressors are shipping throughout the study area and commercial fishing in the marine sector (Figure 5.4). Marine pollution is also widespread in the study area (Figure 5.4), an expected observation since it was assessed using the distribution of shipping and fishing, among other things (see section 4.2.7). The distribution of anchorages, accidental spills, dredging activities, and shipwreck sites, on the other hand, are distributed in an ad hoc manner throughout the study area (Figure 5.4). A number of these stressors, however, overlap at high intensity within environments that are also exposed to shipping, fishing, and pollution; these stressors thus contribute to the total exposure of the environments most exposed to cumulative stressors in the study area. Figure 5.1: Distribution of cumulative stressors in the study area. Figure 5.2: Distribution of normalized cumulative stressors in the study area Figure 5.3: Distribution of cumulative hotspots in the study area Figure 5.4: Distribution of cumulative stressors in the study area for each category of environmental stressors considered in this study. In cases where the stressors is composed of a single category (i.e. anchorages and shipwrecks), this corresponds to the log-transformed and standardised intensity of those stressors. 5.2 Cumulative valued components The method used to obtain the following results is presented in section 3.2.2.2 of the report. The assessment of cumulative valued components shows that the entire study area is covered by at least one valued component (Figures 5.5 and 5.6). Coastal environments, however, are generally covered by a greater number of valued components. This is primarily influenced by the bank integrity and habitat valued components, which are predominantly described as coastal, and by a significant number of areas of interest in coastal environments (Figure 5.7). The entire fluvial coastal environment is characterized by several valued components, but the Lake St. Pierre region, including both upstream and downstream areas, appears to be particularly important (Figures 5.5 and 5.6). On closer examination, this region is characterized by a significant diversity of habitats and areas of interest, and has several categories of erosion-sensitive banks (Figure 5.7). In general, the fluvial sector is characterized by more valued components than the marine sector. The area of the marine sector presenting with the greatest number of valued components is the mouth of the Saguenay River, which essentially covers the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park (Figures 5.5 and 5.6). This observation is based on the important diversity of marine mammals that frequent this region and on a large number of areas of interest (Figure 5.7). It is also important to remember that the characterization of the bank integrity valued component was limited to the fluvial sector only. Figure 5.5: Distribution of cumulative valued components in the study area. Figure 5.6: Distribution of normalized cumulative valued components in the study area. Figure 5.7: Distribution of cumulative valued components in the study area for each category of valued component. 5.3 Cumulative exposure The method used to obtain the following results is presented in section 3.2.2.3 of the report. As a reminder, the spatial distribution of cumulative exposure is entirely constrained by the areas of overlap between environmental stressors and valued components, i.e. stressors and valued components must occur within the same environments to obtain a cumulative exposure value. The cumulative exposure assessment shows that valued components are exposed to stressors throughout the study area (Figures 5.8 and 5.9). However, some environments appear to be particularly exposed to stressors. In the fluvial sector, the Quebec City area and the southern part of Île d’Orléans, as well as the shipping channel between Trois-Rivières and Montreal, including Lake St. Pierre, are especially exposed to stressors. In the marine sector, the area most exposed to stressors is the mouth of the Saguenay River within the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park, particularly on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River up to the portion of the Saguenay that covers the crossing between Tadoussac and Baie-Sainte-Catherine. High-exposure environments are characterized by a significant diversity of valued components (Figure 5.5) and environmental stressors (Figure 5.1). For example, the Sorel-Tracy region, which extends into Lake St. Pierre, has several habitat types, areas of interest, and erosion-sensitive environments (Figure 5.7); this same region is also characterized by a significant presence of commercial shipping, anchorage sites, accidental spills, shipwreck sites, annual dredging operations, and a greater risk of marine pollution (Figure 5.7). Similarly, the mouth of the Saguenay River is characterized primarily by high shipping pressure (Figure 5.4) that overlaps with a significant diversity of marine mammals (Figure 5.7); in addition, there are several habitats and sites of importance, as well as more ad hoc stressors such as spills, anchorage sites, and commercial fishing (Figures 5.4 and 5.7). Figure 5.8: Distribution of the cumulative exposure of valued components to environmental stressors in the study area. Figure 5.9: Distribution of the normalized cumulative exposure of valued components to environmental stressors in the study area. Figure 5.10: Distribution of the cumulative exposure of valued components to environmental stressors in the study area for each category of valued component. 5.4 Cumulative effects The method used to obtain the following results is presented in section 3.2.1 of the report. The main result of the assessment applies the overall cumulative effects assessment model by including the distribution and intensity of environmental stressors, the distribution of valued components, and the vulnerability of valued components to environmental stressors. The presentation of the results of the overall model has thus already been initiated by exploring the results of the partial models (see sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3). By including the vulnerability of valued components to the environmental stressors, the overall model allows for modulation of the intensity of the predicted cumulative effects; thus, the distribution of cumulative effects may be similar to that of cumulative exposure, but the relative intensity of the predicted effects may be greater or lesser depending on the vulnerability of the valued components (see section 3.2 for more details). The results of the cumulative effects assessment reveal that the environments most affected by environmental stressors are similar to those identified by the cumulative exposure assessment (Figures 5.8 and 5.11); a similar interpretation can therefore be made regarding the spatial distribution of cumulative effects. The valued components are at risk for cumulative effects of marine activity-related environmental stressors throughout the study area. The environments most at risk from cumulative effects of marine vessel activities are those with a greater overlap of valued components (Figure 5.5) and environmental stressors (Figure 5.1). Within the fluvial sector, the Quebec City and southern Île d’Orléans regions, as well as the entire shipping channel between Trois-Rivières and Montreal, including Lake St. Pierre, are particularly at risk; the mouth of the Saguenay River is the marine sector region most affected by stressors related to marine vessel activities (Figure 5.11 and 5.12). In terms of valued components, these environments display a significant diversity of habitats and areas of interest, as well as areas where bank integrity is at risk from marine vessel activities throughout (Figure 5.12 and 5.7). These environments are also subject to a wide variety of high-intensity environmental stressors (Figure 5.4) Within the marine sector, predicted cumulative effects are broadly distributed at low intensity (Figure 5.11). Only the mouth of the Saguenay River shows more intense cumulative effects (Figure 5.11) which are largely dictated by the effects of shipping on marine mammals that frequent this region of the study area (Figure 5.12). In addition to marine mammals, several areas of interest were also identified in this region (Figure 5.12). Figure 5.11: Distribution of the cumulative effects of environmental stressors on valued components in the study area. Figure 5.12: Distribution of the cumulative effects of environmental stressors on bank integrity, habitats, marine mammals et sites of cultural, heritage and archeoliglca interest in the study area. 5.5 Pathways of effect The proposed cumulative effects assessment theoretically allows for the exploration of all combinations of stressors and valued components included in the assessment. Considering the 25 categories of stressors and the 77 categories of valued components, there are nearly 2,000 possible pairs; these pairs form the set of direct pathways of effect that environmental stressors can take to affect valued components. A pathway of effect links activities to their potential impacts on various aspects of the ecosystem (DFO, 2020). Although we cannot explore all of these area of interest within this report, Figures 5.13 and 5.14 provide a visual representation of all of these combinations and the contribution of stressors to the total cumulative effects predicted for each valued component considered. The total effects of environmental stressors on valued components were assessed by the sum of the effects divided by the total area of the valued component on which an effect is predicted. For example, if a habitat with an area of 2 \\(km^2\\) is affected by two stressors with predicted effects of 0.25 and 0.75, respectively, the total effect on the valued component is 0.5 \\(km^{-2}\\). The greater the spatial distribution of a stressor, the greater its total effect is likely to be; similarly, total effects are likely to be greater the less widely distributed a valued component is. The figure 5.13 visualizes the set of predicted direct area of interest within the cumulative effects assessment. The links represent the presence of a predicted effect of a stressor on a valued component. The size of the points represents the total predicted effects on the valued components or originating from the environmental stressors. It is important to note that this figure should not be interpreted in detail; rather, it provides an at-a-glance view of the amount of information available within the cumulative effects assessment conducted. There are 1358 direct area of interest with an average relative effect of 0.11 \\(\\pm\\) 0.15, considering that the maximum possible relative effect is 1 based on our assessment method. Figure 5.14 complements Figure 5.13 and makes it possible to explore the area of interest in more detail by presenting the relative contribution of each stressor to the predicted effects for each valued component. The significant effects of shipping and marine pollution on all valued components considered are noted. These results are expected since these stressors are the most prevalent among those considered for the assessment. In general, the other environmental stressors have smaller total effects, except for commercial fisheries, which affect some categories of valued components more intensely, such as mollusk beds and some cultural, heritage and archeological areas of interest. The lower total effects can be explained by the more ad hoc distribution of other environmental stressors within the study area. Cultural, heritage, and archeological areas of interest are the most exposed to the effects of marine activity-related stressors. It should be noted, however, that all areas of interest were considered vulnerable to all environmental stressors; as such, a spatial overlap between a stressor and an area of interest was sufficient to identify a pathway of effect. This means that a comparison between total effects on areas of interest and other valued components should be avoided, or at least take into account the maximum vulnerability attributed to areas of interest. Nevertheless, this is an important result that is informative about the exposure of areas of interest to marine vessel activities in the study area. In addition to areas of interest, bank integrity is the most affected valued component, primarily by shipping and to a lesser extent, by dredging activities. Total habitat effects vary by habitat type, although habitats are affected by a wide variety of environmental stressors. Finally, the least affected valued component is marine mammals. However, it is important to remember that these species cover a very large area and accordingly, the assessment per \\(km^2\\) underestimates the predicted cumulative effects scores. An analysis specifically targeting the critical environments of these species would undoubtedly increase the total predicted effects on marine mammals. It is also important not to downplay the cumulative effects on marine mammals since one of the areas at greatest risk of cumulative effects from marine vessel activities is at the mouth of the Saguenay River due to the significant presence of marine mammals (Figures 5.11 and 5.12). Figure 5.13: Multiplex network showcasing the presence of an effect of environmental stressors on each valued component included in the cumualtive effects assessment (i.e. colored links), total cumulative effects on each valued component (i.e. size of valued components points), et mean predicted cumulative effect of environmental stressors on all valued components (i.e. size of environmental stressors points). This visualization presents the quantity of information available in the dataset generated by the cumlative effects assessment. Figure 5.14: Mean contribution per \\(km^2\\) of environmental stressors to the cumulative effects on each valued component in the study area 5.6 Administrative regions A cumulative effects assessment by \\(km^2\\) of the 11 administrative regions (Ministère de l’Énergie et des Ressources naturelles, 2021b) separating the study area was also conducted to explore regional differences in the intensity of the cumulative effects (Figures 5.15 and 5.16). The overall assessment combining all the valued components reveals that the administrative regions of the fluvial sector are much more at risk from the cumulative effects of marine vessel activities, while the marine sector seems less at risk. The Montérégie in particular seems to be the region most impacted by the effects of marine vessel activities. These observations are due to the concentration of marine vessel activities within a much narrower corridor within the fluvial sector compared to the marine sector. While this observation is not surprising, it does suggest that an increase in marine traffic in the marine sector may have disproportionate impacts in the fluvial sector if that traffic moves to the Great Lakes. This means that an additional vessel going through Quebec City cannot be interpreted in the same way as an additional vessel in Montreal. By extension to shipping, the second most important stressor in the administrative regions of the fluvial sector is the risk of marine pollution. The types of vessels with the most significant effects are those related to the transport of goods (e.g. oil tankers, dry cargo, freighters and container ships). Government vessels also appear to have the potential to negatively affect the valued components in the study area, likely due to less constrained waterway routes and thus more widespread, lower intensity activities throughout the study area. The government and research shipping category, however, is composed of a significant diversity of vessel types, including military craft, patrol vessels, and scientific research vessels. This diversity increases the uncertainty with regard to how vulnerable the valued components are to this type of shipping, and accordingly, to the predicted effects.

Figure 5.16: Mean contribution per \\(km^2\\) of environmental stressors to cumulative effects on bank integrity, habitats, marine mammals, and sites of cultural, heritage and archeological interest in the study area.

As such, this assessment is expected to be a first step in establishing a sustainable, cyclical assessment process. This section therefore presents some of the limitations and perspectives related to the methodology used, the elements making up the profile of the study area, and the results of the assessment. Limitations related to the scope of the study are also presented in section 2.5 of the report, although some are reiterated in that section. Areas of cultural, heritage and archeological interest The characterization of First Nations cultural, heritage and archeological areas of interest is accompanied by a series of limitations and considerations for interpreting the results that should be consulted by any reader wishing to properly interpret the results of the cumulative effects assessment for those areas of interest. These limitations are presented in the report’s section 4.3.5.1. Nonetheless, the integration of social and cultural aspects represents a major gap in cumulative effects assessments in general. It was not possible, for example, to assign vulnerability values to the areas of interest identified by the participating First Nations; although difficult, some First Nations representatives indicated to us that an assessment of the vulnerability of the areas could make it possible to identify certain areas that are more susceptible to risk than others from marine vessel activities. This work was beyond both our mandate and expertise; the results presented are therefore essentially limited to the assessment of the cumulative exposure of the areas of interest to marine activity related environmental stressors. In response to this finding, a related study was initiated with the team of Roxane Lavoie, a professor at the École supérieure d’aménagement du territoire et de développement régional of Université Laval, to focus specifically on the socio-cultural dimensions of the cumulative effects assessment. The project, entitled St. Lawrence Cultures and Nations, aims to understand how Indigenous communities have experienced the intensification of marine vessel activities on the river and how their territorial attachment has been affected. This project is being carried out working closely with representatives of the W8ban-Aki, Huron-Wendat, Innu, Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) and Wolastoqiyik nations. It is funded by Transport Canada and the Quebec Marine Network (Réseau Québec maritime, RQM). Perspective The results of the cumulative effects assessment presented in this report could be used to inform the Cultures et Nations Saint-Laurent project. Similarly, the Cultures et Nations Saint-Laurentcould provide avenues for interpretation of the results of this study to further explore the potential consequences of the cumulative effects of marine vessel activities in environments of importance to First Nations that are particularly at risk. Regional assessment As noted in the introduction to the report, a limitation of this assessment is its sectoral focus on marine vessel activities related to shipping; it cannot be considered an exhaustive cumulative effects assessment addressing the full range of concerns raised by local communities. A more integrative regional cumulative effects assessment would require that the full range of environmental stressors affecting the study area, such as climate change and land-based stressors (e.g. Beauchesne et al., 2020) be considered. The addition of these other stressors could cover the valued component of water quality, which remains a valid concern for local communities. Perspective: The St. Lawrence River Region Regional Assessment recently authorized by the Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada in response to a request from the Mohawk Nation of Kahnawà:ke may also have the potential to cover other important stressors. We believe that the assessment conducted in this pilot project should support and inform this regional assessment. Saguenay River The Saguenay River is not identified as an area being at risk of cumulative effects from shipping in our cumulative effects assessment. However, this finding must be contextualized. Indeed, there is a general lack of knowledge about this region of the study area, such that it is not possible, in light of our assessment, to determine the real risks posed by marine vessel activities in this region. Perspective Focus on an ecological, social and cultural characterization of the Saguenay River and redo a cumulative effects assessment. Habitat characterization The habitat characterization used for the cumulative effects assessment presented in this pilot project presents two types of habitats: 1) habitats representing unique ecosystems and 2) habitats representing environments of importance to species. The environments of importance to species do not represent an ecosystem, but rather sites that are known to be important to certain species or groups of species. These sites are obviously found within habitats such as wetlands and aquatic grass beds. As such, the identification of these unique, precarious or vulnerable sites could be used to assign a higher vulnerability to the different types of habitats in which they are found. For example, a wetland that is home to species at risk may be more vulnerable to the effects of stressors than a wetland with no known species at risk. However, a comprehensive habitat description could not be obtained for the entire study area. Therefore, habitats of importance to species were selected as discrete habitats rather than as a criterion for adjusting habitat vulnerability. Perspective: Complete an exhaustive characterization of habitats and define/add criteria to assess their vulnerability and redo a cumulative effects assessment. Habitat vulnerability The habitat vulnerability assessment was based on previous studies that used 107 experts to assess vulnerability scores for 19 habitat types to 53 environmental stressors (Kappel et al., 2012; Teck et al., 2010) and this work has been repeated, revised, and adapted many times since (Clarke Murray et al., 2015b, 2015a; e.g. Maxwell et al., 2013; Trew et al., 2019). However, none of these studies is specific to our study area or conducted in freshwater environments. Perspective: Conduct a review of the scores used to assess habitat vulnerability to environmental stressors with experts in the study area and redo a cumulative effects assessment. For example, it would be relevant to validate whether the vulnerability used for government and research shipping is appropriate in the context of our study area compared to the original Kappel et al. (2012) study. Intra-annual and seasonal variations The exposure of valued components to environmental stressors may show intra-annual or seasonal variations. For example, shipping is less intense in winter than in summer; the effects of an accidental spill will not be the same when there is ice cover. In the case of a complete time lag between a valued component and a stressor, the vulnerability assessment can be used to fill this gap; this is what we did for the vulnerability of harp seals to marine mammal watching activities (see section 4.4.3). Vulnerability alone, however, is not sufficient for considering more complex temporal dynamics. The proposed cumulative effects assessment thus assumes that overall, the annual dynamics are consistent. The study of the temporal dynamics of cumulative effects is, however, a topic that is not often mentioned in the literature on cumulative effects assessments similar to the one carried out as part of this project. It would therefore be relevant to expand these assessments to consider temporal exposure in addition to spatial exposure. Perspective: Characterize seasonal dynamics and develop an approach for considering variations in temporal exposure of valued components to environmental stressors in the cumulative effects assessment. For example, analyses could be separated into seasons and cumulative effects assessment results could be presented by season. Study grid resolution The cumulative effects assessment was conducted by integrating the categories of environmental stressors and valued components within a 1 $km^2 grid. This is a fine spatial resolution for a regional assessment covering such a large area. However, the study area is composed of two distinct sectors: the fluvial sector and the marine sector. The marine sector is spatially vast; the fluvial sector, on the other hand, is winding and much narrower. Consequently, the cumulative effects of marine vessel activities are much more concentrated in the fluvial sector than in the marine sector. Perspective: Divide the fluvial sector with a grid at a resolution finer than 1 \\(km^2\\), re-do the environmental stressor categories and valued components, and re-do a cumulative effects assessment. Enhancing the profile of the study area Data access and availability is a limitation of the previously cited study; data is also a major perspective, as new data can be incorporated into the proposed cumulative effects assessment methodology. Some perspectives on the characterization of environmental stressors and valued components are occasionally discussed within the portrait de la zone d’étude. Over the course of the project, however, some relevant data could not be incorporated for a variety of reasons. We present here some examples of data that we believe should be included in a second phase of this pilot project. This list should not be considered exhaustive, however, as the overall profile of the study area could be improved. Coastal Resilience Project A bank characterization exercise similar to the one used for the fluvial sector (Bernier et al., 2020; Bernier et al., 2021) was recently completed by Pascal Bernatchez’s team at the Université du Québec à Rimouski. This large-scale project, entitled Projet Résilience Côtière [tr.: Coastal Resilience Project], presents a characterization of bank integrity, a characterization of coastal habitats and various types of coastal ecosystems, and sites of importance for coastal uses such as recreational activities, sites of high socio-cultural value, sites of ecological interest and recognized heritage sites. When made available, these data could be used to improve characterization of the integrity of banks, habitats and areas of cultural, heritage and archeological interest. Marine noise Marine noise is recognized as a shipping-related stressor that should be considered when properly assessing the effects of marine vessel activities on marine mammals. A characterization of marine noise is available through the Ocean soundscape atlas. However, these data are not accessible through the interactive tool and we were unable to obtain them for the assessment. If these data are made available, they should be included in an update to the marine vessel activities cumulative effects assessment. *** Aquatic grass beds *** Aquatic grass beds are important environments for several species and the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks (Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs, MFFP) and the Ministry of the Environment and the Fight Against Climate Change (Ministère de l’Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, MELCC), as part of the knowledge acquisition projects for the Centre of Expertise in Maritime Incident Risk Management (Centre d’expertise en gestion des risques d’incidents maritimes, CEGRIM), are working on an update of the characterization of aquatic grass beds in various sectors of the study area. Once completed, this update could be integrated into the habitat characterization. Commercial fisheries in the fluvial sector Commercial fishing is conducted in the fluvial sector of the study area. However, the available data could not be obtained since the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Ministère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation du Québec, MAPAQ) and the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks (Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs, MFFP) are currently working on the production of a cartographic atlas of the fishing areas that should be published in 2022. When available, data from this atlas should be integrated into the cumulative effects assessment to improve the characterization of commercial fishing activities in the study area. Shipwrecks Our assessment currently deems shipwreck sites environmental stressors. However, shipwrecks are also archeological sites that are part of Quebec’s heritage; they could therefore be considered a valued component of areas of cultural, heritage and archeological interest. A characterization of the archeological areas of interest is available through the Inventory of Archeological Sites in Quebec (Inventaire des sites archéologiques du Québec) of the Ministry of Culture and Communications (Ministère de la Culture et des Communications). However, we were not able to access this inventory during our assessment. It would therefore be relevant to add the data from this inventory if an update of the cumulative effects assessment is performed. Cumulative Effects Hotspots Perspective: The cumulative effects assessment identified environments in the study area that are particularly at risk from marine vessel activities. These include the Quebec City and southern Île d’Orléans areas, Lake St. Pierre and the shipping channel between Trois-Rivières and Montreal in the fluvial sector, and the mouth of the Saguenay River in the marine sector. Subsequent assessments could further the cumulative effects assessment by conducting a fine-scale analysis that could complement the regional analysis conducted as part of this pilot project. Management scenarios Perspective : In the near future, environmental pressures from both human and natural sources are expected to continue intensifying. Considered collectively, the growing pressures suggest that we will soon be confronted with new complex environmental issues. Our major advantage for testing management scenarios would then be predictive approaches (Dubé, 2003; Hodgson et al., 2019; Jones, 2016). The cumulative effects assessment method used for this pilot project provides this type of predictive approach for assessing the risks associated with the effects of multiple environmental stressors. Predictions of environmental changes could thus be incorporated into the cumulative effects assessment. cumulative effects assessments could explore a range of scenarios for new economic development in the study area, including increased marine traffic, and determine the expected changes in cumulative effects on valued components of interest and provide recommendations for management. Testing such scenarios would allow for an analytical approach to identify proactive management and mitigation measures, which are the next steps in the cumulative effects assessment process outlined in the introduction to this report. Operationalizing cumulative effects assessments Perspective: cumulative effects assessments rely on a significant amount of data; this reality is frequently cited as their major limitation (Hodgson et al., 2019; e.g. Jones, 2016). The necessary data or knowledge is sometimes unavailable, inaccessible, or non-existent. Even when data are available, it can be particularly challenging to assemble a database to conduct a large-scale assessment. These growing data needs highlight the need to leverage acquired knowledge, structure it in an interoperable way – i.e. make it easier to connect separate databases – make them available to all, and build infrastructures that maximize our adaptive management capabilities (Poisot et al., 2013; Reichman et al., 2011; Wilkinson et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2020). It was with these realities in mind that we built this pilot project using a transparent and reproducible approach that allowed for easy integration of new data, adjustment of certain portions of the analyses, and regeneration of all analyses, figures, and tables in the report. A second assessment following this pilot project could then build directly on the work already done. Ultimately, it may be possible to easily update an assessment as new knowledge becomes available with tools and infrastructure that allow for efficient replication. This work, which is more data science in nature, should be prioritized and pursued if a second phase of this pilot project is funded. This approach would contribute directly to the final step in the cumulative effects assessment approach outlined in the introduction to this report, i.e. ensuring monitoring and adaptive management. Interactive exploration of cumulative effects assessments Perspective: As mentioned during the presentation of the assessment results, the interpretation has been limited to broad findings in order to simplify the key messages of this pilot project. It is thus clear that a number of concerns of local communities, experts and First Nations could not be explored in detail. However, the method allows for the exploration of all possible combinations of environmental stressors and valued components. In order to allow this type of exploration, it would be relevant to develop an interactive web tool that would enable a user to select certain valued components and stressors in order to explore the details of the cumulative effects assessment results. This type of tool, where data science and web programming meet, would allow for greater flexibility in exploring the results, but also make a better user experience possible. We have already built this type of tool for stressors in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (Beauchesne et al., 2020): https://david-beauchesne.shinyapps.io/edriversapp/. This tool could be improved to incorporate valued components and the cumulative effects assessment.

Those discussions not only helped in identifying the objectives of this project, but also guided the last two years of work for our research team. We wish to thank the First Nations that engaged in this study for your presence at the consultation workshops, discussions throughout the whole project with our research team, and for the data and knowledge you shared with us. Your implication was crucial to this project. We wished to engage with First Nations with humility and consideration, and it is with humility and consideration that we hope to continue engaging with First Nations in the future. We also wish to thank all the collaborators and organisms that engaged with our team throughout the project. Your openness and willingness to share your knowledge are crucial to cumulative effects assessments and to ecosystem-based management in general; without your work, ours would be impossible. Some of those collaborators are acknowledged directly in the subsections of the portrait of the study area of the report; others are identified in appendix 2. This appendix lists over 60 collaborators and organizations that contributed through discussions and data, or by sharing data on open-data platforms. We also thank members of the St. Lawrence action plan on the project Establishing a common framework for the cumulative effects assessment of maritime activities in the St. Lawrence/Saguenay; your comments and our discussions improved our report until the very end. We sincerely hope that our assessment will be useful to your work and that it will be a source of motivation and inspiration to continue and diversify your efforts in the St. Lawrence. Finally, a special thanks to Catherine Guillemette, Transport Canada, without whom the project would not exist. Simply, your work connected a remarkable network of interested parties that is diversified and invested in an integrative approach to the management of our ecosystems. More importantly, it is your ability to listen and your openness that transformed this project into an adventure with a clear starting point and a finish line left to be discovered. Few project managers possess this ability to adjust their objectives and their expectations throughout a project and we are deeply grateful for the opportunity we had to work closely with you. We can only hope that you will continue working on unifying projects; the social and environmental challenges of tomorrow will need ambassadors like you!
